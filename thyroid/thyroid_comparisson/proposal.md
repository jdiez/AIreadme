# Research Proposal: Clinical and Psychiatric Phenotype Differences in Autoimmune vs. Non-Autoimmune Hypothyroidism

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive cross-sectional and prospective cohort study to identify clinical and psychiatric phenotype differences between autoimmune hypothyroidism (primarily Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and non-autoimmune hypothyroidism across pediatric and adult populations. The findings will establish foundational clinical patterns to guide future biomarker discovery studies.

---

## Background and Rationale

**Hypothyroidism** affects approximately 4-5% of the population, with autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) accounting for the majority of cases in iodine-sufficient regions. While thyroid hormone replacement effectively normalizes TSH levels, many patients report persistent symptoms, particularly psychiatric manifestations including depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and fatigue.

**Key Knowledge Gaps:**

- **Phenotypic heterogeneity**: Current literature treats hypothyroidism as a homogeneous condition, potentially masking distinct clinical patterns based on etiology
- **Psychiatric manifestations**: The relationship between autoimmune processes and neuropsychiatric symptoms remains poorly characterized
- **Age-dependent effects**: Pediatric vs. adult presentations may differ significantly due to developmental neurobiology
- **Biomarker foundation**: No systematic clinical characterization exists to guide targeted biomarker discovery

**Hypothesis**: Autoimmune hypothyroidism presents with distinct psychiatric and clinical phenotypes compared to non-autoimmune hypothyroidism, independent of thyroid hormone levels, due to immune-mediated mechanisms affecting the central nervous system.

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective

To identify and characterize differences in psychiatric phenotypes between autoimmune and non-autoimmune hypothyroidism in both pediatric (6-17 years) and adult (18-65 years) populations.

### Secondary Objectives

1. Compare clinical presentation patterns (symptom profiles, disease progression, treatment response)
2. Assess cognitive function differences across etiological groups
3. Evaluate quality of life and functional impairment patterns
4. Identify age-specific (pediatric vs. adult) phenotypic differences
5. Establish clinical predictors for future biomarker validation studies

---

## Study Design

### Design Type

**Multicenter, cross-sectional study with prospective 12-month follow-up component**

### Study Population

**Inclusion Criteria:**

- **Autoimmune hypothyroidism group**: Confirmed diagnosis with positive anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies (>100 IU/mL) and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, with or without ultrasound evidence of thyroiditis
- **Non-autoimmune hypothyroidism group**: Confirmed hypothyroidism with negative antibodies, including iatrogenic (post-thyroidectomy, radioiodine), congenital, or idiopathic causes
- **Age groups**: Pediatric (6-17 years) and adult (18-65 years)
- Minimum 6 months since diagnosis
- Stable thyroid hormone replacement (if applicable) for ≥3 months

**Exclusion Criteria:**

- Other autoimmune diseases (to isolate thyroid-specific effects)
- Major psychiatric disorders predating hypothyroidism diagnosis
- Neurological conditions affecting cognition
- Current use of psychotropic medications (except stable antidepressants >6 months)
- Pregnancy or postpartum period (<12 months)
- Substance abuse disorders

### Sample Size Calculation

Based on detecting a **medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5)** for psychiatric symptom differences with 80% power and α = 0.05:

- **Per group (autoimmune vs. non-autoimmune)**: n = 128
- **Total sample accounting for 4 groups** (pediatric autoimmune, pediatric non-autoimmune, adult autoimmune, adult non-autoimmune): **n = 512**
- **With 15% attrition for 12-month follow-up**: Target enrollment = **600 participants**

## Expected Outcomes and Impact

### Anticipated Findings

**Hypothesis 1**: Autoimmune hypothyroidism will show higher rates and severity of:
- Depressive symptoms
- Anxiety disorders
- Cognitive complaints (particularly executive function)
- Fatigue independent of thyroid hormone levels

**Hypothesis 2**: Pediatric populations will show distinct patterns:
- Greater impact on neurodevelopmental outcomes
- Different symptom profiles (irritability, academic difficulties)
- Potentially stronger autoimmune-psychiatric associations

**Hypothesis 3**: Clinical phenotype clusters will emerge that cross traditional diagnostic boundaries, suggesting distinct disease subtypes

### Foundation for Biomarker Studies

This study will establish:

1. **Target phenotypes** for biomarker correlation (which psychiatric symptoms to focus on)
2. **Patient stratification criteria** for enriching future studies with high-risk groups
3. **Biological sample repository** with well-characterized clinical phenotypes
4. **Effect size estimates** for powering biomarker validation studies
5. **Candidate mechanisms** to guide biomarker selection (inflammatory, autoimmune, neurometabolic)

### Clinical Impact

- Improved recognition of psychiatric manifestations in autoimmune thyroid disease
- Potential for etiology-specific treatment approaches
- Screening recommendations for psychiatric comorbidity
- Patient stratification for clinical trials

# Psychotic Episodes in Autoimmune vs. Non-Autoimmune Hypothyroidism

## Current Evidence Overview

**Psychotic manifestations in hypothyroidism are relatively rare but clinically significant.** The relationship between thyroid dysfunction and psychosis has been recognized since the historical term **"myxedema madness"** was coined, but systematic comparisons between autoimmune and non-autoimmune etiologies are limited.

---

## Known Associations

### General Hypothyroidism and Psychosis

**Prevalence and Characteristics:**

- Psychotic symptoms occur in approximately **5-15% of severe, untreated hypothyroidism cases**
- More common in elderly patients and with profound thyroid hormone deficiency
- Typical manifestations include paranoid delusions, auditory/visual hallucinations, thought disorders, and catatonia
- Usually resolves with thyroid hormone replacement, though psychiatric medications may be needed acutely

**Classic "Myxedema Madness" Features:**

- Paranoid ideation and persecutory delusions (most common)
- Visual and auditory hallucinations
- Cognitive impairment and confusion
- Psychomotor retardation or agitation
- Depressive features often co-exist

### Autoimmune Hypothyroidism-Specific Considerations

**Hashimoto's Encephalopathy (Steroid-Responsive Encephalopathy Associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis - SREAT):**

This is a **distinct neuropsychiatric syndrome** associated with autoimmune thyroiditis that can present with psychotic features:

- **Key characteristics**: Encephalopathy with elevated anti-thyroid antibodies (particularly anti-TPO), often with normal or near-normal thyroid function
- **Psychiatric manifestations**: Psychosis, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, altered consciousness, seizures, stroke-like episodes
- **Unique feature**: Responds to corticosteroids rather than just thyroid hormone replacement
- **Prevalence**: Rare (estimated 2.1 per 100,000), but likely underdiagnosed
- **Mechanism**: Proposed autoimmune-mediated cerebral vasculitis or direct antibody effects on brain tissue

**Autoimmune Psychosis Hypothesis:**

Emerging evidence suggests autoimmune thyroiditis may increase psychosis risk through:

- **Neuroinflammation**: Anti-thyroid antibodies potentially cross-reacting with brain antigens
- **Cytokine dysregulation**: Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) affecting neurotransmitter systems
- **Blood-brain barrier disruption**: Allowing antibody and immune cell penetration
- **Comorbid autoimmune conditions**: Association with other CNS autoimmune disorders

---

## Evidence Gaps and Research Needs

### Limited Comparative Data

**Current literature limitations:**

1. **Case reports and small series dominate** - no large-scale comparative studies exist
2. **Confounding by severity** - psychosis typically occurs with severe hypothyroidism, making it difficult to separate etiology from disease severity
3. **Diagnostic challenges** - distinguishing primary psychotic disorders from thyroid-related psychosis
4. **Heterogeneous definitions** - varying criteria for "thyroid-related psychosis" across studies
5. **Publication bias** - unusual presentations (like Hashimoto's encephalopathy) more likely to be reported

### Key Unanswered Questions

- **Is psychosis more prevalent in autoimmune vs. non-autoimmune hypothyroidism at equivalent thyroid hormone levels?**
- **Do psychotic symptom profiles differ by etiology?**
- **Are there distinct biomarkers predicting psychosis risk in autoimmune cases?**
- **What is the long-term psychosis risk after thyroid hormone normalization?**
- **Do pediatric and adult populations show different patterns?**

---

## Implications for Your Research Proposal

### Recommended Modifications

**Enhanced Psychosis Assessment:**

I recommend adding specific psychosis screening and assessment to your proposed study:

**Screening Tools:**

- **Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version (PQ-B)** for all participants at baseline
- **Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)** or **Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)** for those screening positive
- **Structured clinical interview** sections specifically addressing psychotic symptoms (already included in SCID-5 and K-SADS-PL)

**Additional Data Collection:**

- **Lifetime history of psychotic symptoms** (even transient)
- **Family history of psychotic disorders** (genetic vulnerability)
- **Timing of psychotic symptoms** relative to thyroid diagnosis
- **Treatment response patterns** (thyroid replacement alone vs. requiring antipsychotics)
- **Neurological examination** to screen for encephalopathy features

**Biomarker Considerations for Future Studies:**

Given the potential autoimmune-psychosis link, your biobank should prioritize:

- **Antibody panels**: Anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin, anti-neuronal antibodies (NMDA receptor, VGKC, GAD65)
- **Inflammatory markers**: High-sensitivity CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β
- **Neuroimaging subset**: Consider brain MRI in participants with psychotic features to assess for encephalopathy
- **CSF analysis**: In consenting participants with psychotic symptoms (antibodies, inflammatory markers)

### Modified Hypotheses

**Additional Hypothesis for Psychotic Phenotypes:**

*Autoimmune hypothyroidism will show higher rates of psychotic symptoms (particularly at subclinical levels) compared to non-autoimmune hypothyroidism, independent of thyroid hormone levels, mediated by neuroinflammatory mechanisms.*

**Specific predictions:**

1. Higher prevalence of attenuated psychotic symptoms in autoimmune group
2. Correlation between anti-thyroid antibody titers and psychotic symptom severity
3. Distinct psychotic symptom profiles (more perceptual disturbances in autoimmune cases)
4. Greater persistence of subtle psychotic symptoms despite thyroid normalization

---

## Statistical Considerations for Psychosis Analysis

### Sample Size Impact

**Psychotic symptoms are relatively rare**, which affects power:

- If prevalence is ~5-10% in hypothyroid populations, your proposed n=600 would yield approximately 30-60 cases
- This provides **adequate power for detecting large effect sizes** (OR ≥ 2.5) in prevalence differences
- May be **underpowered for subgroup analyses** (pediatric vs. adult psychosis patterns)

**Potential solutions:**

- **Oversampling strategy**: Actively recruit participants with history of psychotic symptoms
- **Collaborative approach**: Partner with psychiatric hospitals/clinics to identify cases
- **Broader phenotype definition**: Include attenuated psychotic symptoms and prodromal features (increases prevalence)

### Analytical Approach

**Primary analysis:**

- Compare **prevalence of any psychotic symptoms** (lifetime and current) between autoimmune and non-autoimmune groups
- Logistic regression controlling for thyroid hormone levels, disease severity, and duration

**Secondary analyses:**

- **Symptom dimension analysis**: Compare specific psychotic symptom types (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder)
- **Severity analysis**: Among those with psychotic symptoms, compare severity scores
- **Temporal patterns**: Relationship between symptom onset and thyroid diagnosis/treatment
- **Treatment response**: Resolution patterns with thyroid replacement vs. requiring psychiatric intervention

**Exploratory analyses:**

- **Antibody-symptom correlations**: Relationship between anti-TPO/anti-TG titers and psychotic symptom severity
- **Inflammatory marker associations**: If measured, correlate with psychotic features
- **Cluster analysis**: Identify psychosis-prone phenotypic subgroups

---

## Clinical Implications

### Screening Recommendations

If your study demonstrates increased psychosis risk in autoimmune hypothyroidism:

**Clinical practice changes:**

- Routine psychosis screening in autoimmune thyroid disease patients
- Lower threshold for psychiatric referral
- Patient/family education about neuropsychiatric risks
- Monitoring during treatment initiation (thyroid replacement can transiently worsen psychiatric symptoms)

### Differential Diagnosis Framework

**Your study could establish criteria for distinguishing:**

1. **Primary psychotic disorder** with incidental thyroid disease
2. **Thyroid hormone deficiency-induced psychosis** (resolves with replacement)
3. **Autoimmune-mediated psychosis** (may require immunomodulation)
4. **Hashimoto's encephalopathy** (requires corticosteroids)

This has **major treatment implications** - misdiagnosis could lead to inadequate treatment or unnecessary long-term antipsychotic use.

---

## Literature to Review

**Key papers on thyroid-psychosis associations:**

- Hashimoto's encephalopathy case series and diagnostic criteria
- Autoimmune psychosis and NMDA receptor antibody literature
- Neuroinflammation in psychotic disorders
- Thyroid function in first-episode psychosis cohorts
- Myxedema madness historical and modern case reports

**Methodological references:**

- Psychosis assessment in medical populations
- Rare outcome analysis in clinical research
- Biomarker validation for psychiatric phenotypes

---

## Summary and Recommendations

**Current State of Knowledge:**

- Psychotic symptoms occur in severe hypothyroidism but comparative data by etiology is lacking
- Hashimoto's encephalopathy represents a distinct autoimmune-mediated psychotic syndrome
- Theoretical mechanisms suggest autoimmune hypothyroidism may carry higher psychosis risk
- **No systematic comparative studies exist** - this represents a significant research opportunity

**For Your Proposal:**

✓ **Include psychosis as a key psychiatric phenotype** with dedicated assessment tools  
✓ **Add specific hypotheses** about psychotic symptom differences  
✓ **Consider oversampling** participants with psychotic history  
✓ **Plan for neurological assessment** to identify encephalopathy cases  
✓ **Design biomarker collection** to support mechanistic hypotheses (antibodies, inflammation)  
✓ **Adjust sample size calculations** if psychosis becomes a primary outcome  
✓ **Develop clinical protocols** for managing participants who develop acute psychotic symptoms during the study

**This addition would significantly strengthen your proposal** by addressing an understudied but clinically important question with potential for high-impact findings.

Would you like me to help you develop specific psychosis assessment protocols, refine the statistical approach for rare outcomes, or create a decision algorithm for identifying and managing psychotic symptoms in your study participants?

# Comprehensive Psychosis Assessment Protocols for Hypothyroidism Study

---

## 1. Psychosis Assessment Protocol

### Screening and Diagnostic Pathway

**Three-Tier Assessment Strategy:**

**Tier 1: Universal Screening** (all participants at baseline and follow-ups)  
**Tier 2: Detailed Assessment** (positive screens or clinical concern)  
**Tier 3: Specialized Evaluation** (confirmed psychotic features or encephalopathy)

---

### TIER 1: Universal Screening Protocol

**Administered to all 600 participants at each visit (baseline, months 3, 6, 12)**

#### Primary Screening Tool: Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version (PQ-B)

**Administration details:**

- **Time required**: 5-10 minutes
- **Format**: 21-item self-report questionnaire
- **Scoring**: Yes/no for symptom presence + distress rating (0-3 scale)

**Key domains assessed:**

- Perceptual abnormalities (hallucinations, unusual sensory experiences)
- Unusual thought content (paranoia, magical thinking, ideas of reference)
- Cognitive disorganization
- Negative symptoms (social withdrawal, avolition)

**Pediatric adaptation:**

- Use **PQ-BC (Child version)** for ages 6-17
- Parent/caregiver completes parallel version
- Simplified language for younger children
- Lower threshold for positive screen (≥2 items) due to developmental considerations

#### Supplementary Screening Questions

**Lifetime History Assessment** (baseline only):

1. "Have you ever experienced a period when you heard voices or sounds that others couldn't hear?"
2. "Have you ever had strong beliefs that others thought were strange or unusual?"
3. "Have you ever felt that people were watching you, following you, or trying to harm you when there was no real reason?"
4. "Have you ever felt confused about what was real and what wasn't?"
5. "Have you ever been told by a doctor that you had a psychotic episode, schizophrenia, or similar condition?"

**Timing Questions** (if any positive responses):

- When did these experiences first occur? (before/after/around the time of thyroid diagnosis)
- How long did they last?
- Did they require treatment? (hospitalization, medication)
- Have they occurred more than once?

#### Clinical Red Flags Checklist

**For research staff to document at each visit:**

- Disorganized speech or behavior observed during visit
- Inappropriate affect or bizarre statements
- Evidence of responding to internal stimuli
- Paranoid or suspicious behavior
- Marked social withdrawal reported by family
- Deterioration in functioning since last visit

- Capacity to consent to continued study participation
- Need for psychiatric hospitalization
- Family/caregiver support assessment

---

## 2. Statistical Approach for Rare Outcomes

### Power Analysis for Psychotic Outcomes

**Scenario modeling based on expected prevalence:**

#### Conservative Scenario (5% prevalence in non-autoimmune group)

**Assumptions:**

- Non-autoimmune hypothyroidism: 5% psychotic symptoms
- Autoimmune hypothyroidism: 10% psychotic symptoms (OR = 2.0)
- Total n = 600 (150 per group across 4 groups)

**Power calculation:**

- **Power to detect OR ≥ 2.0**: ~75% (α = 0.05, two-tailed)
- **Power to detect OR ≥ 2.5**: ~90%
- **Minimum detectable OR with 80% power**: 2.2

**Conclusion**: Adequate power for moderate-to-large effect sizes

#### Optimistic Scenario (10% prevalence with broader phenotype)

**If including attenuated psychotic symptoms:**

- Non-autoimmune: 10% any psychotic features
- Autoimmune: 18% any psychotic features (OR = 1.96)

**Power calculation:**

- **Power to detect OR ≥ 1.8**: ~85%
- **Expected cases**: 60 non-autoimmune, 108 autoimmune = 168 total

**Conclusion**: Better power for detecting smaller effect sizes

### Primary Statistical Analyses

#### Analysis 1: Prevalence Comparison

**Outcome**: Any psychotic symptoms (lifetime or current)

**Statistical test**: Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test (if cell counts <5)

**Model**: Logistic regression

```
Psychotic_Symptoms ~ Etiology + Age_Group + Etiology × Age_Group + Covariates
```

**Covariates to include:**

- Current TSH and free T4 levels
- Disease duration
- Disease severity (symptom burden score)
- Age (continuous)
- Sex
- Family history of psychotic disorders
- Substance use history

**Effect size reporting**: Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals

#### Analysis 2: Symptom Severity Among Cases

**Restricted to participants with psychotic symptoms**

**Outcome**: BPRS total score (continuous)

**Statistical test**: Independent t-test or Mann-Whitney U (depending on distribution)

**Model**: Linear regression or quantile regression

```
BPRS_Total ~ Etiology + Age_Group + Covariates
```

**Additional analyses:**

- BPRS subscale scores (positive, negative, disorganization)
- Functional impairment (SOFAS score)
- Treatment requirement (medication, hospitalization)

#### Analysis 3: Symptom Profile Analysis

**Outcome**: Specific psychotic symptom types

**Approach**: Multiple logistic regressions for each symptom type

**Symptom categories:**

- Auditory hallucinations
- Visual hallucinations
- Paranoid/persecutory delusions
- Other delusions (grandiose, somatic, referential)
- Thought disorder
- Negative symptoms

**Multiple comparison correction**: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR (q < 0.05)

**Visualization**: Heat map showing symptom prevalence by etiology and age group

#### Analysis 4: Temporal Relationship Analysis

**Research question**: Does psychosis onset relate to thyroid diagnosis/treatment timing?

**Categories:**

1. Psychosis predated thyroid diagnosis (>6 months before)
2. Psychosis concurrent with thyroid diagnosis (±6 months)
3. Psychosis emerged after diagnosis (>6 months after)
4. Psychosis emerged after treatment initiation

**Analysis**: Multinomial logistic regression with etiology as predictor

**Hypothesis**: Autoimmune group more likely to have concurrent or post-diagnosis psychosis

#### Analysis 5: Longitudinal Trajectory Analysis

**Outcome**: Change in psychotic symptoms over 12 months

**Model**: Mixed-effects logistic or linear regression

```
Psychotic_Symptoms ~ Time × Etiology + Random(Participant) + Covariates
```

**Key parameters:**

- **Time effect**: Overall change in symptoms
- **Etiology effect**: Baseline differences
- **Time × Etiology interaction**: Differential trajectories

**Clinically meaningful outcomes:**

- Symptom resolution rate
- Symptom emergence rate (new cases during follow-up)
- Symptom persistence despite thyroid normalization

---

### Advanced Statistical Techniques

#### Propensity Score Matching

**Rationale**: Control for confounding by indication (disease severity may differ between groups)

**Approach:**

1. **Calculate propensity scores** for autoimmune vs. non-autoimmune etiology based on:
   - Age, sex, BMI
   - Disease severity and duration
   - Thyroid hormone levels
   - Comorbidities
   - Socioeconomic factors

2. **Match participants 1:1** using nearest neighbor or caliper matching

3. **Assess balance** using standardized mean differences (<0.1 indicates good balance)

4. **Repeat primary analyses** in matched cohort

**Advantage**: Reduces bias from systematic differences between groups

#### Rare Events Logistic Regression (Firth's Method)

**Problem**: Standard logistic regression can be biased with rare outcomes

**Solution**: Firth's penalized likelihood approach

**When to use**: If psychotic symptom prevalence <5% in either group

**Implementation**: Use `logistf` package in R or equivalent

**Advantage**: Provides less biased estimates and better confidence intervals for rare outcomes

#### Bayesian Analysis

**Complementary approach to frequentist statistics**

**Advantages for rare outcomes:**

- Incorporates prior knowledge (literature on thyroid-psychosis associations)
- Provides probability statements about effect sizes
- Better handles small sample sizes
- Can quantify evidence for null hypothesis

**Prior specification:**

- **Weakly informative priors** for main effects (e.g., Normal(0, 1) on log-odds scale)
- **Informative priors** based on literature for specific hypotheses (e.g., Hashimoto's encephalopathy prevalence)

**Posterior inference:**

- Probability that OR > 1.5 (clinically meaningful threshold)
- Credible intervals for effect sizes
- Bayes factors for hypothesis comparison

**Software**: Stan, JAGS, or brms package in R

#### Latent Class Analysis (LCA)

**Research question**: Are there distinct psychotic phenotype subgroups?

**Approach:**

1. **Input variables**: Individual psychotic symptoms (binary or ordinal)
2. **Model**: Estimate 2-5 latent classes
3. **Selection**: Use BIC, AIC, and interpretability
4. **Validation**: Test class membership associations with etiology, biomarkers

**Potential classes:**

- "Paranoid-hallucinatory" class
- "Cognitive-disorganized" class  
- "Negative symptom" class
- "Encephalopathy" class

**Hypothesis**: Autoimmune etiology more strongly associated with specific classes

---

### Handling Missing Data

#### Expected Missing Data Patterns

**Reasons for missingness:**

- Participant dropout (estimated 15%)
- Refusal of specific assessments (psychiatric stigma)
- Incomplete questionnaires
- Lost to follow-up

**Missing data mechanisms:**

- **MCAR** (Missing Completely At Random): Random technical issues
- **MAR** (Missing At Random): Missingness related to observed variables (e.g., more severe cases drop out)
- **MNAR** (Missing Not At Random): Missingness related to unobserved variables (e.g., psychotic symptoms cause dropout)

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Prevention:**

- Flexible scheduling for follow-up visits
- Remote assessment options (phone, video)
- Participant retention incentives
- Regular contact between visits
- Minimize assessment burden

**Statistical handling:**

**Multiple Imputation (MI):**

- Use chained equations (MICE) approach
- Generate 20-50 imputed datasets
- Include auxiliary variables (baseline characteristics, other outcomes)
- Pool results using Rubin's rules
- Sensitivity analyses with different imputation models

**Maximum Likelihood Estimation:**

- For longitudinal models (mixed-effects)
- Uses all available data without imputation
- Assumes MAR mechanism

**Sensitivity Analyses:**

- **Best-case scenario**: All missing assumed no psychotic symptoms
- **Worst-case scenario**: All missing assumed psychotic symptoms
- **Pattern mixture models**: Model missingness mechanism explicitly
- **Tipping point analysis**: Determine how much MNAR would change conclusions

### Multiple Comparison Correction Strategy

**Challenge**: Multiple outcomes and subgroup analyses increase Type I error risk

#### Hierarchical Testing Approach

**Primary hypothesis family** (controls overall Type I error at α = 0.05):

1. **Primary outcome**: Any psychotic symptoms (lifetime or current) - autoimmune vs. non-autoimmune
2. **If significant**, test secondary outcomes:
   - Symptom severity (BPRS total)
   - Specific symptom types
   - Age group interactions

**Correction method**: Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure

**Advantage**: More powerful than Bonferroni while controlling family-wise error rate

#### False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control

**For exploratory analyses** (symptom profiles, temporal patterns):

- Use Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
- Control FDR at q = 0.05 (5% of significant findings expected to be false positives)
- More appropriate for hypothesis-generating analyses

**Implementation:**

1. Rank all p-values from smallest to largest
2. Find largest p-value where p ≤ (rank/total tests) × q
3. Reject all hypotheses up to that rank

#### Pre-Specification and Registration

**To enhance credibility:**

- **Pre-register analysis plan** on ClinicalTrials.gov or Open Science Framework
- **Distinguish confirmatory from exploratory analyses** in reporting
- **Report all planned analyses** regardless of results (avoid selective reporting)

---

### STEP 4: Treatment Recommendations

**Based on diagnostic formulation**

#### Scenario A: Thyroid-Related Psychosis (Hormone Deficiency)

**Clinical features:**

- Severe hypothyroidism (TSH >20 mIU/L)
- Psychosis emerged with thyroid decompensation
- No prior psychiatric history

**Treatment approach:**

1. **Optimize thyroid hormone replacement**
   - Adjust levothyroxine dose
   - Monitor TSH every 4-6 weeks
   - Target TSH 0.5-2.5 mIU/L

2. **Short-term antipsychotic** if needed for symptom control
   - Low-dose atypical antipsychotic (risperidone 0.5-2 mg, olanzapine 2.5-5 mg)
   - Taper as thyroid normalizes
   - Monitor for side effects

3. **Close monitoring**
   - Weekly psychiatric assessment initially
   - Assess for symptom resolution
   - Functional status tracking

**Expected course**: Resolution within 2-8 weeks of thyroid normalization

**Study implications**: Continue participation; valuable data on treatment response

---

#### Scenario B: Hashimoto's Encephalopathy

**Clinical features:**

- Elevated anti-thyroid antibodies
- Encephalopathy with cognitive/psychiatric symptoms
- Neurological signs or EEG abnormalities
- May have normal or near-normal thyroid function

**Treatment approach:**

1. **Corticosteroid trial** (requires specialist consultation)
   - Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day or equivalent
   - Typical duration 2-4 weeks with taper
   - Monitor for response within days to weeks

2. **Alternative immunotherapy** if steroid-resistant
   - IV immunoglobulin (IVIG)
   - Plasmapheresis
   - Rituximab (for refractory cases)

3. **Supportive care**
   - Antipsychotics for severe agitation
   - Antiepileptics if seizures present
   - Cognitive rehabilitation

**Expected course**: Dramatic improvement with steroids if true HE

**Study implications**: 

- **Critical data** - document response to immunotherapy
- **Enhanced biomarker collection** (pre/post treatment)
- **Neuroimaging** if possible
- **Long-term follow-up** for relapse monitoring

---

#### Scenario C: Autoimmune-Associated Psychosis (Non-Encephalopathy)

**Clinical features:**

- Autoimmune hypothyroidism with controlled thyroid function
- Persistent psychotic symptoms
- No encephalopathy features
- Elevated inflammatory markers

**Treatment approach:**

1. **Standard psychiatric treatment**

   - Psychosocial support

2. **Consider adjunctive anti-inflammatory strategies** (research context)
   - NSAIDs or celecoxib (if no contraindications)
   - Omega-3 fatty acids
   - Monitor response

3. **Optimize thyroid management**
   - Ensure TSH in optimal range
   - Consider T3 supplementation if high T4/T3 ratio

**Expected course**: Variable; may require ongoing psychiatric treatment

**Study implications**: 

- **Key phenotype** for biomarker studies
- **Longitudinal tracking** of inflammatory markers
- **Treatment response data** valuable

---

#### Scenario D: Primary Psychotic Disorder

**Clinical features:**

- Psychosis predated thyroid diagnosis
