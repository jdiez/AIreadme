While
there are no biomarkers currently used in daily clinical practice for diagnosing acute psychosis, several candidates are under research to improve early identification and treatment. 
Inflammatory & Immune Biomarkers
Studies consistently show that acute psychotic episodes are associated with systemic inflammation. 

    Pro-inflammatory Cytokines: Elevated levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) are frequently found in patients during first-episode psychosis (FEP).
    Hematological Markers: Increased Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and total white blood cell (WBC) counts have been identified as potential markers of acute inflammatory processes.
    C-Reactive Protein (CRP): Elevated median values of CRP suggest persistent systemic inflammation during psychotic disorders. 

Neuroendocrine & Metabolic Biomarkers 

    Cortisol: Abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis often lead to elevated cortisol levels, especially proximate to disease onset.
    Monoamines: Elevated levels of plasma homovanillic acid (pHVA), a dopamine metabolite, may predict response to antipsychotics.
    Oxidative Stress: Lower levels of antioxidants like docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) are observed in FEP patients compared to healthy controls. 

Neurophysiological & Imaging Biomarkers

    EEG/ERP Measures: Abnormalities in neural oscillations, particularly gamma-band deficits, and event-related potentials (ERPs) like mismatch negativity (MMN) and P300 latency are well-replicated biomarkers for psychosis.
    Neuroimaging: Reductions in temporal grey matter volume and changes in ventricle-brain ratio have been linked to the onset of psychotic episodes. 

Would you like to explore how these biomarkers might guide treatment choices, or perhaps delve into the specific diagnostic criteria for psychosis that these biomarkers could support?

Research into biomarkers for acute psychosis is rapidly advancing, with recent studies identifying specific molecular and neural signals that could soon move from laboratory settings into clinical practice.
 
Emerging Blood & Fluid Biomarkers
New "signature" profiles are being developed to objectively measure current severity and future risk. 

    Inflammatory Signatures: Meta-analyses show that concentrations of specific blood-based proteins differ between acute and chronic states. IL-2 and interferon (IFN)-γ are notably elevated during acute illness, whereas chronic illness is marked by lower levels of IL-4 and IL-12.
    Breakthrough Blood Tests: Researchers recently developed a blood test that identifies biomarkers to objectively measure current symptom severity and match patients to the most effective treatments for their biology.
    Vascular & Barrier Markers: Elevated blood levels of S100B and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), alongside an increased CSF-to-serum albumin ratio, suggest blood-brain barrier disturbances during psychotic disorders.
    Metabolomics: Acute schizophrenia is associated with significant metabolic shifts, including decreased arginine and aspartate and increased glucose 6-phosphate. 

Neural Connectivity & Imaging Biomarkers
Advanced MRI techniques have identified structural and functional patterns specific to the onset of psychosis.

    Somato-Visual Biomarker: A 2024 study identified a "somato-visual" biomarker where sensory regions in the cortex are weakly connected to each other but strongly connected to the thalamus.
    Social Motivation Markers: New research links low social motivation in psychotic disorders to activity in specific brain regions, identifying a potential neural marker for social impairment. 

Genomic & Epigenetic Markers

    Pharmacogenomic Markers: Clinical trials are currently using biomarkers like striatal connectivity (via fMRI) and genotypes such as MC4R and HLA-DQB1 to predict medication response and risk for side effects like weight gain or agranulocytosis.
    MicroRNAs: A panel of 55 different miRNAs (such as miR-34a and miR-181b) has been found differentially expressed in the blood of psychotic patients, with some correlating to the improvement of negative symptoms. 

Clinical Workup for Acute Psychosis
In standard clinical practice, laboratory testing is used primarily to rule out secondary causes (differential diagnosis). 

    Initial Labs: Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, liver and thyroid function tests, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine.
    Toxicity Screens: Testing for substance use is critical, as drug abuse can both trigger psychosis and influence immune-inflammatory factors.

It sounds like you're looking for the bottom line on how this actually helps a patient right now.
While we can't run one single "psychosis blood test" yet, doctors use a "rule-out" panel to make sure the episode isn't caused by a hidden physical illness. If you or someone you know is undergoing an evaluation, here is the "must-check" list:
1. The "Must-Check" Lab Panel
These are used to catch physical issues that "mimic" a psychotic episode:

    Thyroid (TSH/T4): To rule out "Myxedema Madness" (extreme hyper/hypothyroidism). Cleveland Clinic Guide
    Metabolic Panel: Checks for electrolyte imbalances (like low sodium) or kidney/liver failure that can cause delirium.
    Vitamin B12/Folate: Severe deficiencies can lead to paranoia and hallucinations. NIH Fact Sheet
    Syphilis (RPR) & HIV: Both can cross into the brain and cause acute psychiatric symptoms.

2. Substance & Toxicity Screening
Crucial for determining if the episode is "primary" (mental health) or "secondary" (drug-induced):

    Urine Toxicology: Screening for amphetamines, synthetic cannabinoids ("K2"), and PCP.
    Alcohol Levels: Acute withdrawal (Delirium Tremens) is a medical emergency that looks like psychosis.

3. The Future: Brain Connectivity
The most exciting "real-world" biomarker currently being moved into clinics is functional connectivity.

    The Somato-Visual Test: Recent research suggests that looking at how the thalamus communicates with sensory regions of the brain can predict a psychotic break before it even happens. News-Medical Reporting

Psychosis is a complex condition, and a medical professional can provide a comprehensive evaluation and discuss appropriate next steps.

Vocal and sleep biomarkers are among the most promising areas for objective diagnosis, as they reflect underlying neurobiological shifts that occur before and during an acute episode.
Vocal Biomarkers in Acute Psychosis
Advanced acoustic and linguistic analysis can detect subtle changes in speech that often escape the human ear during a standard clinical interview. 

    Acoustic Features:
        Reduced Pitch Variability: Often described as "flat affect" or monotone speech, this is a highly reliable marker for schizophrenia-spectrum disorders.
        Loudness Irregularities: Changes in loudness parameters have been uniquely associated with psychotic symptoms, specifically distinguishing them from anxiety or depression.
        Tone Perturbations: Increased "jitter" (frequency instability) and "shimmer" (amplitude instability) can indicate the harshness or roughness sometimes observed in psychotic states.
    Temporal & Linguistic Features:
        Speech Latency: Increased time taken to respond to a question is a significant marker for psychosis, reflecting cognitive and motivational deficits.
        Disfluency & Verbosity: Conceptual disorganization—a hallmark of acute psychosis—is often marked by more disfluent speech and, occasionally, excessive verbosity.
        Fragmented Coherence: Linguistic analysis often reveals a lack of thematic coherence and difficulty in word retrieval, which correlates with positive symptoms. 

Sleep Biomarkers in Acute Psychosis
Sleep disturbances are often prodromal, meaning they frequently precede and may even precipitate an acute psychotic break. 

    Sleep Architecture Abnormalities:
        Reduced Sleep Spindles: Deficits in sleep spindle density, amplitude, and duration—oscillations initiated by the thalamus—are established biomarkers for early and chronic psychosis.
        Diminished Slow-Wave Sleep (SWS): Patients in a first episode often show significantly reduced deep "slow-wave" sleep, which correlates with more severe psychotic symptoms.
        REM Disruption: Reduced REM sleep latency (entering REM faster) and decreased REM duration are common during acute episodes and correlate with higher symptom severity.
    Efficiency & Patterns:
        Increased Sleep Latency: Patients frequently struggle to initiate sleep, taking much longer than healthy controls.
        Circadian Misalignment: Passive sensing (via smartphones) has shown increased phone usage during traditional sleep hours as a digital marker for conceptual disorganization and symptom severity. 

Current Clinical Status
While these markers are not yet used for standalone diagnosis, they are increasingly used in digital phenotyping and clinical trials to monitor treatment response and predict relapses. Tracking these patterns via wearables or apps may soon provide a "smoke alarm" system for early intervention.
