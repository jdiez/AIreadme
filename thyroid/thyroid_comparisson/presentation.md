# Research Proposal: Psychiatric Phenotypes in Autoimmune vs. Non-Autoimmune Hypothyroidism

---

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Identify clinical and psychiatric phenotype differences between autoimmune and non-autoimmune hypothyroidism to establish foundations for biomarker discovery

**Design**: Multicenter cross-sectional study with 12-month prospective follow-up

**Population**: Pediatric (6-17 years) and adult (18-65 years) patients

**Sample Size**: 600 participants (150 per group across 4 groups)

**Duration**: 36 months

---

## Background & Rationale

### The Problem

**Hypothyroidism affects 4-5% of the population**, with autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's) being the most common cause

**Despite adequate thyroid hormone replacement**, many patients report persistent symptoms:

- Depression and anxiety
- Cognitive dysfunction
- Fatigue
- Psychotic symptoms (rare but significant)

### Knowledge Gaps

- Current literature treats hypothyroidism as homogeneous
- Relationship between autoimmune processes and neuropsychiatric symptoms poorly characterized
- Age-dependent effects (pediatric vs. adult) understudied
- No systematic clinical characterization to guide biomarker discovery

---

## Primary Hypothesis

**Autoimmune hypothyroidism presents with distinct psychiatric and clinical phenotypes compared to non-autoimmune hypothyroidism, independent of thyroid hormone levels, due to immune-mediated mechanisms affecting the CNS**

---

## Study Design Overview

### Design Type

**Cross-sectional + Prospective Cohort**

- Baseline comprehensive phenotyping
- Follow-up at months 3, 6, and 12

### Four Study Groups

1. **Pediatric Autoimmune** (n=150)
2. **Pediatric Non-Autoimmune** (n=150)
3. **Adult Autoimmune** (n=150)
4. **Adult Non-Autoimmune** (n=150)

**Total enrollment target**: 600 (accounting for 15% attrition)

---

## Inclusion Criteria

### Autoimmune Group

- Positive anti-TPO antibodies (>100 IU/mL) and/or anti-thyroglobulin antibodies
- With or without ultrasound evidence of thyroiditis

### Non-Autoimmune Group

- Confirmed hypothyroidism with negative antibodies
- Includes iatrogenic, congenital, or idiopathic causes

### All Participants

- Minimum 6 months since diagnosis
- Stable thyroid hormone replacement ≥3 months (if applicable)
- Age 6-17 (pediatric) or 18-65 (adult)

---

## Exclusion Criteria

- Other autoimmune diseases (to isolate thyroid-specific effects)
- Major psychiatric disorders predating hypothyroidism diagnosis
- Neurological conditions affecting cognition
- Current psychotropic medications (except stable antidepressants >6 months)
- Pregnancy or postpartum period (<12 months)

---

## Assessment Timeline

---

## Psychiatric Phenotyping (Primary Outcomes)

**Adults**: SCID-5 (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5)

**Pediatrics**: K-SADS-PL (Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia)

### Standardized Rating Scales

**Depression**:
- Adults: BDI-II, HAM-D
- Pediatrics: CDI-2

---

## Psychosis Assessment Protocol

### Three-Tier Approach

**Tier 1: Universal Screening** (all participants)
- Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Version (PQ-B)
- Lifetime psychosis history questions
- Clinical red flags checklist

**Tier 2: Detailed Assessment** (positive screens)
- SCID-5 or K-SADS-PL psychotic disorders module
- Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)
- Cognitive screening (MMSE/MoCA)
- Functional assessment (SOFAS)

**Tier 3: Specialized Evaluation** (severe cases)
- Psychiatrist evaluation
- Hashimoto's encephalopathy assessment
- Neurological examination
- Advanced investigations (EEG, MRI, CSF if indicated)

---

## Psychotic Manifestations: Special Focus

### Why Focus on Psychosis?

**Rare but clinically significant** (5-15% of severe hypothyroidism)

**Distinct autoimmune syndrome**: Hashimoto's encephalopathy (SREAT)
- Psychosis with elevated anti-thyroid antibodies
- Often normal thyroid function
- Responds to corticosteroids

**Proposed mechanisms**:
- Neuroinflammation
- Anti-thyroid antibodies cross-reacting with brain antigens
- Cytokine dysregulation
- Blood-brain barrier disruption

---

## Clinical Decision Algorithm

### Severity Triage

**High Urgency** → Emergency intervention
- Active suicidal/homicidal ideation
- Severe disorganization
- Acute confusional state

**Moderate Urgency** → Prompt assessment (48-72 hours)
- Psychotic symptoms causing distress
- Functional impairment
- Suspected Hashimoto's encephalopathy

**Low Urgency** → Routine follow-up (1-2 weeks)
- Mild attenuated symptoms
- Historical symptoms, currently stable

---

## Biological Sample Collection

**For future biomarker studies** (stored, not analyzed in this phase):

- Serum (10 mL) - inflammatory markers, cytokines
- Plasma (5 mL) - metabolomics
- Whole blood (5 mL) - genetic studies
- Storage at -80°C with standardized protocols

**Enhanced collection for psychotic cases**:
- Antibody panels (anti-neuronal antibodies)
- Inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP)
- Neuroimaging (if clinically indicated)
- CSF (only if clinically indicated)

---

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### Sample Size & Power

**Based on detecting medium effect size (Cohen's d = 0.5)**:
- 80% power, α = 0.05
- n = 128 per group
- Total n = 512 (600 with 15% attrition)

**For psychotic outcomes** (assuming 5-10% prevalence):
- Power to detect OR ≥ 2.0: ~75-85%
- Expected 30-60 cases for analysis

---

## Primary Statistical Analyses

### Analysis 1: Prevalence Comparison

**Outcome**: Any psychotic symptoms (lifetime or current)

**Method**: Logistic regression

```
Psychotic_Symptoms ~ Etiology + Age_Group + 
                      Etiology × Age_Group + Covariates
```

**Covariates**: TSH, free T4, disease duration, age, sex, family history

---

## Primary Analyses (Continued)

### Analysis 2: Symptom Severity Among Cases

**Outcome**: BPRS total score (continuous)

**Method**: Linear regression or quantile regression

### Analysis 3: Symptom Profile Analysis

**Outcome**: Specific psychotic symptom types

**Method**: Multiple logistic regressions with FDR correction

**Symptom categories**:
- Auditory/visual hallucinations
- Paranoid/persecutory delusions
- Thought disorder
- Negative symptoms

---

## Secondary Analyses

### Analysis 4: Temporal Relationship

**Research question**: Does psychosis onset relate to thyroid diagnosis timing?

**Categories**:
1. Predated thyroid diagnosis
2. Concurrent with diagnosis
3. Emerged after diagnosis
4. Emerged after treatment initiation

### Analysis 5: Longitudinal Trajectory

**Model**: Mixed-effects regression

**Key parameters**:
- Time effect (overall change)
- Etiology effect (baseline differences)
- Time × Etiology interaction (differential trajectories)

---

## Advanced Statistical Techniques

### Handling Rare Outcomes

**Propensity Score Matching**
- Control for confounding by disease severity
- 1:1 matching on key covariates

**Firth's Penalized Likelihood**
- Reduces bias for rare events
- Better confidence intervals

**Bayesian Analysis**
- Incorporates prior knowledge
- Probability statements about effect sizes
- Better for small samples

**Latent Class Analysis**
- Identify distinct psychotic phenotype subgroups
- Test associations with etiology

---

## Multiple Comparison Correction

### Hierarchical Testing Approach

**Primary hypothesis family** (α = 0.05):
1. Any psychotic symptoms (primary)
2. If significant → test secondary outcomes

**Method**: Holm-Bonferroni sequential procedure

### Exploratory Analyses

**False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control**
- Benjamini-Hochberg procedure
- Control FDR at q = 0.05
- Appropriate for hypothesis-generating analyses

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1**: Autoimmune hypothyroidism will show higher rates and severity of:
- Depressive symptoms
- Anxiety disorders
- Cognitive complaints
- Fatigue independent of thyroid hormone levels
- **Psychotic symptoms**

**Hypothesis 2**: Pediatric populations will show distinct patterns:
- Greater neurodevelopmental impact
- Different symptom profiles
- Potentially stronger autoimmune-psychiatric associations

---

## Expected Outcomes (Continued)

### Hypothesis 3: Clinical Phenotype Clusters

**Expectation**: Distinct disease subtypes will emerge that cross traditional diagnostic boundaries

### Psychosis-Specific Predictions

1. Higher prevalence of attenuated psychotic symptoms in autoimmune group
2. Correlation between anti-thyroid antibody titers and psychotic symptom severity
3. Distinct psychotic symptom profiles (more perceptual disturbances in autoimmune cases)
4. Greater persistence despite thyroid normalization

---
