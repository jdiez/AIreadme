# CONSIDERATIONS

1.- Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Hashimoto's diseases is more than probably an hetherogenous group of clinical entities. Same applies to Hashimoto's encephalopathy.
2.- There isn't a clear immunological and psychiatric phenotyping.
3.- Management probably doesn't include key specialists and patient communication and follow up is incomplete and partial.
4.- Autoimmune hypothyroidism should include a better immunological profiling and clinical follow up to better classify patients using specific biomarkers.
5.- Clinical and psychiatric profiling should allow predictive biomarkers.

Psychosis systematic evaluation by psychiatrists and neurologists, along with serum and CSF antibody testing as performed here.
Nevertheless, the currentfindings and those of previous studies (table 5)12 have important implications.
Among patients with FEP, a small percentage (most likely <1%) have CSF NMDAR-abs; this is expected given that many patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis initially present with psychosis.
