# CONSIDERATIONS


1.- Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Hashimoto's diseases is more than probably an hetherogenous group of clinical entities. Same applies to Hashimoto's encephalopathy.
2.- There isn't a clear immunological and psychiatric phenotyping.
3.- Management probably doesn't include key specialists and patient communication and follow up is incomplete and partial.
4.- Autoimmune hypothyroidism should include a better immunological profiling and clinical follow up to better classify patients using specific biomarkers.
5.- Clinical and psychiatric profiling should allow predictive biomarkers.
