# 1. SPECIFIC AIMS

Autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) affects 5-10% of the population with a 10:1 female predominance and is associated with diverse neuropsychiatric manifestations ranging from subtle cognitive changes to overt Hashimoto's encephalopathy.<sup>1-3</sup> Emerging evidence suggests these neuropsychiatric symptoms represent a spectrum of **neuroautoimmune encephalitis** mediated by cross-reactive antibodies, cytokine dysregulation, and neuroinflammation.<sup>4-6</sup> Subclinical psychotic symptoms—including attenuated hallucinations, unusual thought content, and thought disorganization—are frequently observed clinically but remain systematically understudied in this population.<sup>7,8</sup>

**Critical gaps** in current knowledge include: (1) lack of systematic characterization of subclinical psychotic symptoms in autoimmune thyroiditis across age groups; (2) absence of objective biomarkers for early detection, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment; (3) gender bias in psychiatric assessment, with females' psychotic symptoms frequently underdiagnosed or misattributed;<sup>9,10</sup> and (4) limited understanding of the relationship between neuroinflammation and psychiatric symptoms in imaging-negative encephalitis.<sup>11,12</sup>

**Vocal biomarkers** offer a promising solution. Speech production integrates multiple neural systems affected by neuroinflammation, including prefrontal-subcortical circuits, language networks, and dopaminergic pathways.<sup>13-15</sup> Recent advances in computational speech analysis and natural language processing have demonstrated that acoustic and linguistic features can detect psychotic symptoms with high accuracy,<sup>16-18</sup> provide objective assessment independent of clinician bias, and enable scalable, remote monitoring.<sup>19,20</sup>

**Our central hypothesis** is that neuroinflammation in autoimmune thyroiditis produces detectable alterations in vocal acoustic and linguistic features that correlate with subclinical psychotic symptoms, even in the absence of structural brain imaging abnormalities. We further hypothesize that these vocal biomarkers will respond to anti-inflammatory treatment (corticosteroids), validating their utility as state markers of neuroinflammatory psychiatric disease.

## SPECIFIC AIMS

### **AIM 1: Characterize the prevalence, phenomenology, and clinical correlates of subclinical psychotic symptoms in pediatric and adult patients with autoimmune thyroiditis**

**Hypothesis 1a:** Subclinical psychotic symptoms will be present in 15-25% of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, with distinct symptom profiles (positive-predominant, negative-predominant, disorganized, mixed).

**Hypothesis 1b:** Symptom severity will correlate with inflammatory markers (IL-6, anti-TPO antibody titers, CRP) and cognitive dysfunction, independent of thyroid hormone levels.

**Approach:** We will conduct comprehensive psychiatric phenotyping using gold-standard instruments (Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes [SIPS], SCID-5) and neurocognitive assessment in 350 patients (175 pediatric [ages 10-17], 175 adult [ages 18-65]) with confirmed autoimmune thyroiditis. Clinical phenotypes will be classified by symptom profile, severity, and inflammatory status.

### **AIM 2: Identify vocal acoustic and linguistic biomarkers that differentiate patients with subclinical psychotic symptoms from those without, and validate these biomarkers against clinical phenotypes**

**Hypothesis 2a:** Patients with subclinical psychotic symptoms will demonstrate specific vocal abnormalities including reduced semantic coherence, decreased prosodic variation, altered speech timing, and simplified syntax compared to patients without symptoms.

**Hypothesis 2b:** Vocal biomarkers will show symptom-specific patterns: positive symptoms will correlate with semantic abnormalities; negative symptoms with prosodic flattening; disorganization with reduced syntactic complexity and discourse coherence.

**Hypothesis 2c:** Vocal biomarkers will demonstrate concordance with clinical assessment (κ ≥ 0.60) while detecting additional subclinical cases missed by traditional evaluation.

**Approach:** Standardized vocal recordings will undergo automated feature extraction (acoustic, linguistic, discourse-level). Machine learning models will classify symptom presence, severity, and profile. Clinical-digital concordance will be systematically evaluated, with detailed analysis of discordant cases.

### **AIM 3: Assess the responsiveness of vocal biomarkers to corticosteroid treatment in a prospective intervention substudy, validating their utility as state markers of neuroinflammatory psychiatric disease**

**Hypothesis 3a:** Patients with subclinical psychotic symptoms who respond to corticosteroid treatment will show significant improvement in vocal biomarkers paralleling clinical improvement.

**Hypothesis 3b:** Baseline vocal biomarker profiles will predict treatment response, with specific features (e.g., prosodic abnormalities, semantic tangentiality) showing differential sensitivity to anti-inflammatory intervention.

**Hypothesis 3c:** Vocal biomarker changes will correlate with reductions in inflammatory markers (IL-6, CRP) and improvements in cognitive function.

**Approach:** A subset of 60 patients with clinically significant symptoms will undergo an 8-week open-label corticosteroid trial with assessments at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (post-taper). Longitudinal trajectories of clinical symptoms, vocal biomarkers, inflammatory markers, and cognitive function will be analyzed using mixed-effects models.

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND IMPACT

This study will provide: (1) the first systematic characterization of subclinical psychotic symptoms in autoimmune thyroiditis; (2) validated vocal biomarkers for objective, gender-unbiased detection of neuroinflammatory psychiatric symptoms; (3) evidence linking vocal features to neuroinflammation and treatment response; and (4) a scalable digital phenotyping framework applicable to other autoimmune conditions.

**Clinical impact** includes earlier detection of at-risk patients, reduced diagnostic bias, objective monitoring of treatment response, and potential for remote screening applications. **Scientific impact** includes advancing understanding of the brain-immune interface, establishing vocal biomarkers as functional indicators of neuroinflammation, and providing a methodological framework for digital phenotyping in autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders.

# 2. RESEARCH STRATEGY

## A. SIGNIFICANCE

### 1. Public Health Burden and Unmet Clinical Need

**Autoimmune thyroiditis** is one of the most common autoimmune conditions, affecting approximately 5-10% of the general population, with prevalence reaching 15-20% in women over age 60.<sup>21,22</sup> While traditionally viewed as an endocrine disorder, accumulating evidence demonstrates significant neuropsychiatric comorbidity including depression (30-60%), anxiety (30-50%), and cognitive impairment (20-40%).<sup>23-25</sup>

**Hashimoto's encephalopathy**, the severe end of the neuropsychiatric spectrum, occurs in approximately 2-5 per 100,000 population annually,<sup>26</sup> presenting with seizures, cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and movement disorders. However, this likely represents only the "tip of the iceberg," with many patients experiencing **subclinical or mild neuropsychiatric manifestations** that go unrecognized and untreated.<sup>27,28</sup>

**Subclinical psychotic symptoms**—attenuated hallucinations, unusual thought content, suspiciousness, and thought disorganization—are particularly concerning because they:
- Significantly impair quality of life and functional capacity<sup>29</sup>
- Increase risk for progression to threshold psychotic disorders<sup>30,31</sup>
- Are frequently missed or misdiagnosed, especially in females<sup>32,33</sup>
- May respond to anti-inflammatory treatment if identified early<sup>34,35</sup>

Despite clinical observations of psychotic symptoms in autoimmune thyroiditis,<sup>36,37</sup> **no systematic studies** have characterized their prevalence, phenomenology, or underlying mechanisms in this population.

### 2. Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms: The Missing Link

Recent research has fundamentally shifted understanding of Hashimoto's encephalopathy from a rare, idiosyncratic reaction to a **neuroinflammatory disorder** on a continuum with milder presentations.<sup>38-40</sup>

**Pathophysiological evidence** includes:

**Direct autoimmune mechanisms:**
- Anti-thyroid antibodies (anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin) cross-react with neuronal antigens, particularly in cerebellum, hippocampus, and cortex<sup>41,42</sup>
- Anti-neuronal antibodies (anti-NAE, anti-GAD) are detected in 60-80% of Hashimoto's encephalopathy cases<sup>43,44</sup>
- Antibody-mediated complement activation causes neuronal damage<sup>45</sup>
- Blood-brain barrier disruption allows antibody penetration and immune cell infiltration<sup>46</sup>

**Indirect inflammatory mechanisms:**
- Elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, IFN-γ) affect neurotransmitter metabolism and synaptic function<sup>47,48</sup>
- Chronic microglial activation disrupts neural circuits<sup>49</sup>
- Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction impair neuronal function<sup>50</sup>
- Inflammation-induced alterations in dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate systems parallel mechanisms in primary psychotic disorders<sup>51,52</sup>

**Critical insight:** Neuroinflammation produces **functional neuronal dysfunction** before structural damage, explaining why 30-50% of autoimmune encephalitis cases show **normal conventional MRI** despite significant symptoms.<sup>53,54</sup> Advanced imaging (FDG-PET, fMRI) may reveal metabolic or functional abnormalities,<sup>55</sup> but these techniques are expensive and not widely available.

**Corticosteroid responsiveness** provides both diagnostic and therapeutic validation. Studies report 60-90% response rates in Hashimoto's encephalopathy,<sup>56,57</sup> with improvement typically within 2-4 weeks, supporting neuroinflammatory etiology. However, response in milder, subclinical presentations remains unstudied.

### 3. Gender Bias in Psychiatric Assessment: A Critical Equity Issue

**Psychotic symptoms in females are systematically underdiagnosed** due to multiple factors:<sup>58-60</sup>
- Atypical presentations (more affective symptoms, less disorganization)
- Later age of onset allowing development of compensatory strategies
- Clinician bias toward diagnosing mood disorders in women
- Self-report bias and help-seeking differences

In autoimmune thyroiditis, with 90% female predominance, this gender bias is particularly problematic. **Objective biomarkers** that operate independently of clinician interpretation could significantly reduce diagnostic disparities.

### 4. Vocal Biomarkers: A Paradigm Shift in Psychiatric Assessment

**Speech production integrates multiple neural systems** affected by neuroinflammation:
- **Prefrontal cortex:** Executive control of speech planning and monitoring<sup>61</sup>
- **Anterior cingulate:** Conflict monitoring and error detection<sup>62</sup>
- **Basal ganglia:** Dopaminergic motor planning affecting prosody<sup>63</sup>
- **Language networks:** Broca's area, Wernicke's area, arcuate fasciculus<sup>64</sup>
- **Default mode network:** Narrative construction and self-referential processing<sup>65</sup>

**Vocal biomarkers in psychosis research** have demonstrated:

**Acoustic features:**
- Reduced prosodic variation (flattened affect) in negative symptoms<sup>66,67</sup>
- Altered speech timing and increased pauses in thought disorder<sup>68</sup>
- Voice quality changes reflecting motor control disruption<sup>69</sup>

**Linguistic features:**
- Reduced semantic coherence predicts psychosis onset in high-risk youth<sup>16,17</sup>
- Syntactic simplification correlates with cognitive deficits<sup>70</sup>
- Increased tangentiality and derailment in formal thought disorder<sup>71,72</sup>

**Predictive validity:**
- Automated speech analysis predicts psychosis conversion with 83% accuracy<sup>17</sup>
- Semantic coherence outperforms clinical assessment for prediction<sup>16</sup>
- Longitudinal changes track symptom progression<sup>73</sup>

**Advantages over traditional assessment:**
- **Objective:** Reduces clinician and patient bias
- **Quantitative:** Enables dimensional measurement and precise tracking
- **Scalable:** Can be deployed remotely via smartphone
- **Ecologically valid:** Captures real-world functioning
- **Gender-independent:** Operates on acoustic/linguistic features, not subjective interpretation

### 5. Knowledge Gap and Study Rationale

**No prior studies** have:
1. Systematically characterized subclinical psychotic symptoms in autoimmune thyroiditis
2. Applied vocal biomarker analysis to autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders
3. Examined vocal features as markers of neuroinflammation
4. Assessed vocal biomarker responsiveness to anti-inflammatory treatment
5. Compared clinical and digital phenotyping in this population

This study addresses these gaps, with potential to **transform clinical practice** by providing objective, scalable tools for early detection and monitoring of neuroinflammatory psychiatric disease.

## B. INNOVATION

### 1. Novel Application of Digital Phenotyping to Autoimmune Neuropsychiatry

This is the **first study** to apply computational vocal analysis to neuropsychiatric manifestations of autoimmune disease. While vocal biomarkers have been studied in primary psychotic disorders,<sup>16-20,66-73</sup> their application to **secondary psychosis** due to neuroinflammation represents a conceptual advance with broad implications for autoimmune encephalitis, neuroinflammation in general, and the brain-immune interface.

### 2. Imaging-Negative Neuroinflammation: A New Paradigm

By focusing on patients with **functional neuroinflammatory changes** that may not manifest on structural imaging, this study challenges the traditional requirement for imaging abnormalities in autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis.<sup>53,54</sup> Vocal biomarkers may provide **functional evidence** of neuroinflammation when imaging is normal, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment.

### 3. Treatment-Responsive Biomarkers: Validation Through Intervention

The corticosteroid intervention substudy provides **mechanistic validation** of vocal biomarkers as state markers of neuroinflammation. Demonstrating that vocal features normalize with anti-inflammatory treatment would:
- Confirm neuroinflammatory etiology of vocal abnormalities
- Validate biomarkers as treatment response indicators
- Enable objective monitoring in clinical trials
- Support use as surrogate endpoints

This approach is **innovative** because most biomarker studies are purely observational; we directly test whether biomarkers track with disease activity.

### 4. Comprehensive Clinical-Digital Phenotype Integration

Rather than treating digital biomarkers as replacements for clinical assessment, we systematically compare and integrate both approaches. This **hybrid framework**:
- Assesses concordance and discordance between methods
- Identifies complementary information from each approach
- Evaluates incremental validity of combined assessment
- Develops optimal clinical decision support strategies

This represents a **methodological innovation** applicable beyond this specific study.

### 5. Gender Equity Through Objective Assessment

By developing **gender-independent** biomarkers and explicitly testing for algorithmic bias, this study addresses health equity in psychiatric diagnosis. The systematic evaluation of gender-specific performance represents a **novel approach** to bias mitigation in digital health.

### 6. Developmental Perspective: Pediatric and Adult Cohorts

Parallel assessment of pediatric and adult populations enables examination of **developmental factors** in neuroinflammatory psychiatric manifestations. This is particularly important given that:
- Autoimmune thyroiditis can present in childhood/adolescence<sup>74</sup>
- Adolescence is a critical period for psychosis risk<sup>75</sup>
- Vocal features show developmental changes requiring age-appropriate normative data<sup>76</sup>

### 7. Multi-Modal Biomarker Integration

Integration of vocal biomarkers with inflammatory markers, cognitive assessment, and clinical phenotypes provides a **systems-level understanding** of neuroinflammatory psychiatric disease. This multi-modal approach is essential for:
- Understanding mechanisms linking inflammation to symptoms
- Identifying subgroups with different pathophysiology
- Developing personalized treatment strategies

### 8. Translational Pathway: From Discovery to Clinical Application

The study is designed with **clinical implementation** in mind:
- Standardized recording protocols feasible in clinical settings
- Open-source analysis tools for reproducibility
- Decision support framework for clinical integration
- Scalability to smartphone-based applications

This **translational focus** distinguishes the study from purely exploratory research.

- Clear procedures for managing acute psychiatric crises

**Protections:**
- Trained staff sensitive to vulnerabilities
- Referral resources for clinical care
- Safety protocols for suicidality or acute symptoms
- Flexibility to accommodate needs

#### 8.5 Incidental Findings

**Definition:** Clinically significant findings discovered during research that are not the focus of the study

**Management Plan:**
- Participants informed during consent that incidental findings may be discovered
- Significant findings (e.g., severe depression, suicidality, cognitive impairment) disclosed to participant and (with permission) their clinician
- Referrals provided for clinical follow-up
- Documentation of disclosure and referral

**Examples:**
- Suicidal ideation: Immediate safety assessment, referral to emergency services if needed
- Severe cognitive impairment: Referral to neurology or neuropsychology
- Abnormal lab values: Referral to primary care or endocrinology

#### 8.6 IRB Oversight

**Initial Review:**
- Full board review (greater than minimal risk for intervention substudy)
- Approval from all participating sites' IRBs
- Reliance agreements if using single IRB

**Continuing Review:**
- Annual renewal
- Progress reports including enrollment, adverse events, protocol deviations
- Modifications submitted for approval before implementation

**Adverse Event Reporting:**
- SAEs reported to IRB within 24 hours
- Unanticipated problems reported within 5 business days
- Annual summary of all adverse events

### 9. INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES

#### 9.1 Inclusion of Women

**Rationale:**
- Autoimmune thyroiditis has 10:1 female predominance
- Expected enrollment: ~80% female, ~20% male
- This reflects disease epidemiology and ensures adequate female representation

**Gender-Specific Considerations:**
- Analysis of gender differences in symptom presentation and vocal features
- Assessment of gender bias in clinical vs. digital phenotyping
- Evaluation of algorithmic fairness across genders

**Pregnancy:**
- Females of childbearing potential excluded from intervention substudy due to corticosteroid risks
- Pregnancy testing required before enrollment in intervention substudy

#### 9.2 Inclusion of Minorities

**Recruitment Strategy:**
- Targeted recruitment from diverse clinical settings
- Community outreach to underserved populations
- Collaboration with community health centers
- Culturally sensitive recruitment materials

**Target Enrollment:**
- Reflect local population demographics
- Minimum 30% racial/ethnic minorities
- Specific targets:
  - Hispanic/Latino: 15-20%
  - Black/African American: 10-15%
  - Asian: 5-10%
  - Other: 5%

**Cultural Considerations:**
- Bilingual staff if needed
- Culturally appropriate communication
- Flexibility in scheduling and location
- Address barriers to participation (transportation, childcare)

**Analysis:**
- Examine racial/ethnic differences in symptom presentation and treatment response
- Assess for algorithmic bias across racial/ethnic groups
- Report enrollment and outcomes by race/ethnicity
