Pay attention to:

> Multimodal analysis for assessment and rehabilitation of disabling neurological disorders
> Disabling neurological disorders are diseases or injuries of the central nervous system that cause impairment of any part of the body. They include diseases of both central and peripheral nervous systems such as epilepsy and stroke. The project aims at the development of new methods and e-health systems for evaluating impairments in neurological disabling disorders based on a multimodal approach, considering information of neurological, cardiorespiratory and muscular origin.
