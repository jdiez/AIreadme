## 1. Introduction: Transforming ODSAI Innovation from Ad Hoc to Systematic

### Current State Assessment

#### Innovation Without Methodology

**Fragmented Approach**: Currently, ODSAI innovation projects emerge organically through individual initiatives, research collaborations, and opportunistic partnerships. While this has generated valuable technical achievements, it lacks the systematic approach needed to consistently translate scientific breakthroughs into scalable clinical and commercial solutions.

**Inconsistent Evaluation**: Project selection and progression decisions often rely on technical merit and scientific interest rather than systematic assessment of clinical need, market viability, and strategic alignment. This creates a disconnect between technical excellence and real-world impact.

**Resource Inefficiency**: Without structured validation frameworks, significant resources are invested in projects that may ultimately fail to address genuine stakeholder needs or achieve sustainable implementation, leading to suboptimal return on innovation investment.

**Limited Stakeholder Integration**: Current innovation processes primarily focus on technical development, with limited systematic engagement of clinicians, patients, commercial teams, and other key stakeholders during the critical early stages of project development.

#### Previous Assessment Insights

**Technical Capability Strength**: ODSAI demonstrates exceptional technical capabilities in AI model development, data science methodologies, and oncology domain expertise. The team consistently produces high-quality research outputs and proof-of-concept solutions.

**Translation Gap**: Despite strong technical foundations, there exists a significant gap between proof-of-concept development and scalable implementation. Many promising technical solutions struggle to progress beyond pilot phases due to unclear value propositions and business models.

**Stakeholder Alignment Challenges**: Previous projects have encountered difficulties in aligning diverse stakeholder expectations and requirements, often discovering misalignment late in the development process when changes become costly and time-consuming.

**Measurement and Learning Limitations**: Current approaches lack systematic mechanisms for capturing and applying lessons learned across projects, resulting in repeated challenges and missed opportunities for knowledge transfer.

### The Need for Systematic Innovation

#### Market and Competitive Pressures

**Accelerating Competition**: The AI in healthcare market is rapidly evolving, with new entrants and established players launching innovative solutions. AstraZeneca needs more systematic innovation approaches to maintain competitive advantage and market leadership.

**Stakeholder Expectations**: Healthcare providers, payers, and patients increasingly expect AI solutions that demonstrate clear clinical value, seamless integration, and sustainable business models—requirements that demand systematic validation approaches.

**Regulatory Evolution**: Evolving regulatory frameworks for AI in healthcare require more structured evidence generation and validation processes from the earliest stages of innovation development.

#### Internal Strategic Imperatives

**Portfolio Optimization**: AstraZeneca's commitment to data-driven decision making requires more systematic approaches to innovation portfolio management and resource allocation within ODSAI.

**Cross-Functional Integration**: Successful AI innovation increasingly requires seamless collaboration between technical teams, clinical experts, commercial functions, and external partners—integration that benefits from structured methodologies.

**Scalability Requirements**: As ODSAI grows and takes on more ambitious innovation challenges, ad hoc approaches become increasingly insufficient for managing complex, multi-stakeholder innovation initiatives.

## 11. Strategyzer Methodology: Framework and Resources

### Overview of Strategyzer Methodology

#### Foundation and Philosophy

**Strategyzer** was founded by **Alexander Osterwalder** and **Yves Pigneur**, building on their groundbreaking work in business model innovation that began with the creation of the Business Model Canvas. The methodology is based on the principle that innovation success requires systematic approaches to understanding customers, designing value propositions, and testing business model assumptions before making significant investments.

The Strategyzer approach emphasizes **evidence-based innovation** through structured experimentation, moving organizations away from opinion-based decision making toward data-driven validation of critical business assumptions.

#### Core Methodology Components

##### Business Model Canvas

**Purpose**: Provides a visual framework for describing, designing, challenging, and pivoting business models.

**Nine Building Blocks**:
- **Value Propositions**: The bundle of products and services that create value for specific customer segments
- **Customer Segments**: Different groups of people or organizations an enterprise aims to reach and serve
- **Channels**: How a company communicates with and reaches its customer segments to deliver value
- **Customer Relationships**: Types of relationships a company establishes with specific customer segments
- **Revenue Streams**: Cash a company generates from each customer segment
- **Key Resources**: Most important assets required to make a business model work
- **Key Activities**: Most important actions a company must take to operate successfully
- **Key Partnerships**: Network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work
- **Cost Structure**: All costs incurred to operate a business model

**ODSAI Application**: For AI innovation projects, the Business Model Canvas helps map how data science solutions create value for different healthcare stakeholders, from clinicians and patients to payers and pharmaceutical partners.

##### Value Proposition Canvas

**Purpose**: Achieves fit between what you make and what customers want through systematic analysis of customer needs and corresponding value creation.

**Customer Profile Components**:
- **Customer Jobs**: Tasks customers are trying to perform, problems they're solving, or needs they're satisfying
- **Pains**: Bad outcomes, risks, and obstacles related to customer jobs
- **Gains**: Outcomes and benefits customers want to achieve

**Value Map Components**:
- **Products & Services**: List of what you offer to help customers get jobs done
- **Pain Relievers**: How your products and services alleviate customer pains
- **Gain Creators**: How your products and services create customer gains

**ODSAI Application**: Essential for understanding complex healthcare stakeholder needs and ensuring AI solutions address real clinical workflows, patient outcomes, and operational challenges.

##### Testing and Validation Framework

**Testing Cards Methodology**: Systematic approach to designing experiments that test critical business model assumptions with minimal time and resource investment.

**Testing Categories**:
- **Desirability Testing**: Do customers want this solution?
- **Feasibility Testing**: Can we build and deliver this solution?
- **Viability Testing**: Should we build this solution (business case)?

**Evidence Progression**: Framework for moving from weak evidence (opinions, assumptions) to strong evidence (validated customer behavior and measurable outcomes).

**ODSAI Application**: Particularly valuable for healthcare AI where regulatory requirements, clinical validation, and stakeholder adoption create complex validation requirements.
