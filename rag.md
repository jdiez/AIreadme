# RAG

## Multiple data models

- [bRAG](https://github.com/bRAGAI/bRAG-langchain/)

> This repository contains a comprehensive exploration of
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for various applications.
  Each notebook provides a detailed, hands-on guide to setting up and
  experimenting with RAG from an introductory level to advanced implementations,
  including multi-querying and custom RAG builds.
