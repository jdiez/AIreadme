## Week 3

Welcome to [week three](https://eu.degreed.com/pathway/3pmvz453pn/pathway?newWindow=true), time to understand the power of your strengths!  
 
A valuable part of this module is to identify your top five Strengths. Everyone has their own combination of strengths and knowing yours will help you maximise their impact and consistently apply them to get positive outcomes. 
 
You will receive an email to complete your CliftonStrengths assessment with Gallup. You may not receive this if you have already completed a CliftonStrengths assessment with your AstraZeneca account. Please note that the results are confidential and only visible to you. We encourage you to own your development and to share results with your buddy group. 
 
Instructions: 
> 1. Please click the link “GET STARTED” in the email from Gallup support@mail.gallup.com to access the portal. 
> 2. You need to set up a new account and then select an option “Take the CliftonStrengths assessment”. 
> 3. You can then select your preferred language, using the drop-down menu on the top right-hand side of the screen. 
> 4. Column1. When you have selected your language, you can begin the assessment. 
> 5. When you have completed the assessment, please follow the instructions to download your 34 CliftonStrengths Assessment Report. 
 
Don’t forget we have our Second Workshop this week – Maximising your presence. It’s a great opportunity to network with other participants in the programme. There’s nothing you need to prepare, just come ready to participate and share your experiences.  
 
- Action ITEM #1: Look out for the Gallup email from support@mail.gallup.com. Make sure you sign in using that email to launch the assessment.  
- Action Item #2: Complete your assessment to download your 34 strengths report that you will use in workshop 3: Understanding Your Strengths
