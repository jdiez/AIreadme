### üîÅ **Workflow Stages:**

1. **Identify & Capture: Harvesting Tacit Knowledge**
 - **Goal:** Extract undocumented expertise.
 - **Action:** Conduct structured interviews with domain experts about objects, events, states, and causality.
 - **Output:** Raw glossary of terms and relationships.
 - **Tools:** Miro, Otter.ai.

2. **Curate & Formalize: Transforming Chaos to Structure**
 - **Goal:** Create a structured model from raw knowledge.
 - **Action:** Develop taxonomy using SKOS; model core concepts with OntoUML.
 - **Output:** Formal OWL ontology and SKOS taxonomy.
 - **Tools:** PoolParty, Prot√©g√©.

3. **Model & Structure: Building the Digital Brain**
 - **Goal:** Establish the organization's "digital brain"‚Äîthe Knowledge Graph.
 - **Action:** Populate ontology with instances; transform existing data sources into RDF triples.
 - **Output:** Populated, queryable Knowledge Graph.
 - **Tools:** GraphDB, Stardog.

4. **Deploy & Integrate: Embedding Knowledge into Workflows**
 - **Goal:** Ensure knowledge is accessible at the point of need.
 - **Action:** Integrate semantic search; create chatbots or recommenders based on user context within the KG.
 - **Output:** Seamless access to knowledge in tools (Slack, Teams).
 - **Tools:** Semantic search plugins.

5. **Validate & Govern: Ensuring Quality Assurance**
 - **Goal:** Maintain accuracy of the KG. 
 - **Action:** Write SHACL shapes for validation rules; establish governance for new terms. 
 - **Output:** High-quality trusted knowledge base. 
 - **Tools:** Prot√©g√© (SHACL), Stardog/GraphDB.

6. **Execute, Learn, Retire: The Continuous Loop**
 - **Goal:** Foster a learning organization. 
 - **Action:** Use KG for problem-solving; capture new insights; archive outdated knowledge based on analytics. 
 - **Output:** Continuously improving knowledge system.
