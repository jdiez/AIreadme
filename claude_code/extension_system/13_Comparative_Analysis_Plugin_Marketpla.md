## 8. Decision Framework

### When to Choose Each Option

**Choose AZ Plugin Marketplace When:**
- ✅ Security and compliance are critical (pharmaceutical industry)
- ✅ Need organization-wide adoption (not just developers)
- ✅ Require deep integration with AZ systems
- ✅ Want measurable ROI and analytics
- ✅ Building long-term innovation culture
- ✅ Need centralized governance and control
- ✅ Have budget for strategic investment

**Choose Claude Native Features When:**
- ⚠️ Small pilot with limited scope
- ⚠️ Quick experimentation needed
- ⚠️ Budget constraints are severe
- ⚠️ Limited to individual/team use
- ⚠️ No integration requirements
- ⚠️ Willing to accept external dependency

**Choose GitHub Repository When:**
- ⚠️ Users are primarily developers
- ⚠️ Already using GitHub extensively
- ⚠️ Need version control only
- ⚠️ Can handle manual governance
- ⚠️ Limited budget available
- ⚠️ No non-technical users

---

## 9. Hybrid Approach Consideration

    CORE -->|Sync| GITHUB
    
    style CORE fill:#90EE90
    style CLAUDE fill:#FFD700
    style GITHUB fill:#87CEEB
```

**Best of All Worlds:**
- **AZ Marketplace** as the primary distribution and governance platform
- **Claude Native** for individual experimentation and prototyping
- **GitHub** as the backend version control and development platform
- **Seamless workflow** from experimentation → development → approval → distribution

---

## 10. Final Recommendation

### **Primary Recommendation: Build AZ Plugin Marketplace**

**Rationale:**

1. **Security & Compliance**: Pharmaceutical industry requires rigorous controls that only a custom marketplace can provide

2. **Business Value**: 3x better ROI than alternatives over 5 years ($3.2M vs. $1.1M net benefit)

3. **Strategic Alignment**: Supports AZ's digital transformation and innovation culture goals

4. **User Experience**: Enables 6x broader adoption by making tools accessible to non-developers

5. **Competitive Advantage**: Creates proprietary capability that competitors cannot easily replicate

6. **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates shadow IT and provides complete audit trails for regulatory compliance

7. **Long-term Sustainability**: Builds organizational capability and knowledge capital

**Implementation Path:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Build core marketplace with GitHub backend
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Pilot with 15-20 plugins and early adopters
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-9)**: Organization-wide rollout
- **Ongoing**: Allow Claude native features for experimentation, with marketplace as approval gateway
