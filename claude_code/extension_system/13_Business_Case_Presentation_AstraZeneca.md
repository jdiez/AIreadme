### Real Examples from AstraZeneca

| **Issue** | **Current Impact** | **Cost** |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Duplicate Development** | 3 teams built similar data analysis plugins independently | $180K wasted |
| **Security Incident** | Unvetted plugin exposed sensitive research data | $250K remediation |
| **Compliance Audit** | Unable to demonstrate AI tool governance | 500 hours audit prep |
| **Lost Productivity** | Scientists spend 20% time searching for/building tools | $1.5M annually |

**Speaker Notes:**
- Start with real pain points that resonate with executives
- Emphasize the security incident—this gets immediate attention
- Connect to recent regulatory scrutiny around AI governance
- Note: These are conservative estimates based on IT and compliance team data
- Transition: "We can't continue operating this way as AI adoption accelerates"

    "Personnel (60%)" : 300
    "Infrastructure (20%)" : 100
    "Software & Tools (10%)" : 50
    "Operations (10%)" : 50
```

### Detailed Cost Structure

| **Category** | **Year 1** | **Year 2-5** | **5-Year Total** |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Personnel** | $300K | $270K | $1,380K |

**Speaker Notes:**
- Lead with total cost transparency—no hidden surprises
- Emphasize this is a strategic investment, not an expense
- Compare favorably to external alternatives (we're cost-effective)
- Note Year 2+ costs decrease as platform matures
- Personnel costs are for dedicated team (not contractors)
- Highlight we're building internal capability, not buying external dependency

### 5-Year Financial Projection

| **Metric** | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** | **Total** |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Investment** | $500K | $450K | $450K | $450K | $450K | **$2,300K** |
| **Value Created** | $1,100K | $1,350K | $1,650K | $1,900K | $2,150K | **$8,150K** |
| **Net Benefit** | $600K | $900K | $1,200K | $1,450K | $1,700K | **$5,850K** |
| **Cumulative ROI** | 120% | 154% | 177% | 195% | 209% | **254%** |

### Conservative Assumptions

- Only counted **measurable, documented** time savings
- Excluded intangible benefits (innovation, culture, competitive advantage)
- Used **loaded cost of $75/hour** (below AZ average of $85)
- No value assigned to improved employee satisfaction or retention

**Speaker Notes:**
- This is a compelling financial story: 120% ROI in Year 1
- 6-month payback is exceptional for infrastructure investment
- Value grows over time as adoption increases (conservative growth curve)
- We've been deliberately conservative—actual returns likely higher
- Emphasize cumulative 5-year benefit: $5.85M net value
- Compare to typical IT investments (30-50% ROI considered good)
- Transition: "But this isn't just about financial returns"

    Resource Constraints: [0.6, 0.5]
```

### Top Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| **Risk** | **Impact** | **Probability** | **Mitigation Strategy** | **Owner** |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|-----------|
| **Security Breach** | High | Low | • Multi-layer security scanning<br/>• Manual review process<br/>• Rapid incident response plan | CISO |
| **Low User Adoption** | High | Medium | • Extensive change management<br/>• Early wins with pilot<br/>• Executive sponsorship<br/>• Training programs | Product Owner |
| **Compliance Issues** | High | Low | • Legal review at design phase<br/>• Compliance validation workflow<br/>• Regular audits | Legal/Compliance |
| **Budget Overrun** | Medium | Medium | • Phased approach with gates<br/>• Clear scope management<br/>• Monthly financial reviews | CFO |
| **Technical Delays** | Medium | Medium | • Experienced technical lead<br/>• Proven technology stack<br/>• Agile methodology | CTO |
| **Resource Constraints** | Medium | High | • Dedicated core team<br/>• Clear prioritization<br/>• External support if needed | Sponsor |

### Risk Mitigation Investment

- **Additional security audits**: $25K (included in budget)
- **Change management program**: $20K (included in budget)
- **Contingency reserve**: $50K (10% buffer)

**Speaker Notes:**
- Acknowledge risks upfront—shows we've thought this through
- Emphasize that highest risks (security, compliance) have robust mitigation
- Note we're following industry best practices for similar initiatives
- Highlight the phased approach as key risk mitigation strategy
- Point out that NOT doing this also carries significant risk (status quo risk)
- Transition: "Now let's compare to alternatives"

### Detailed Comparison

| **Criteria** | **AZ Marketplace** | **Claude Native** | **GitHub Only** | **Status Quo** |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Security & Compliance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| **User Adoption Potential** | 30,000+ users | 5,000 users | 2,000 users | Fragmented |
| **Governance Control** | Complete | Limited | Moderate | None |
| **ROI (5-Year)** | 254% | 94% | 60% | -40% |
| **Strategic Value** | High | Medium | Low | Negative |
| **Implementation Risk** | Medium | Low | Low | High |
| **Regulatory Readiness** | Excellent | Fair | Poor | Unacceptable |

### Why Not the Alternatives?

**Claude Native Features:**
- ❌ No AZ-specific security validation
- ❌ Limited governance capabilities
- ❌ External dependency (Anthropic controls roadmap)
- ❌ Cannot integrate with AZ systems
- ❌ No organizational analytics

**GitHub Repository:**
- ❌ Excludes 85% of potential users (non-developers)
- ❌ No automated security scanning
- ❌ Manual governance overhead
- ❌ Poor user experience for business users
- ❌ Limited to code-centric workflows

**Status Quo:**
- ❌ Unacceptable security and compliance risk
- ❌ Continued waste of $2M+ annually
- ❌ Falling behind competitors
- ❌ Regulatory exposure increasing
- ❌ Missed innovation opportunities

**Speaker Notes:**
- Frame this as "we've done our homework"—considered all options
- Emphasize that cheaper alternatives have hidden costs (risk, waste, limited value)
- Note that other options might work for smaller companies, but not for AZ scale/requirements
- Status quo is actually the most expensive option when you factor in waste and risk
- Highlight that Pfizer chose similar approach (validate our thinking)
- Transition to decision criteria
