### Key Talking Points

**The Problem (30 seconds):**
"Right now, AZ employees are building Claude Code plugins independently across the organization. This creates three critical issues:
- **Security risk**: No centralized scanning or governance
- **Wasted resources**: Teams solving the same problems separately—costing us $2M annually
- **Missed opportunities**: No way to discover and share solutions"

**The Opportunity (30 seconds):**
"We can solve this with a centralized Plugin Marketplace—think of it as an 'App Store' for AI tools with built-in security, governance, and discovery. This will:
- Eliminate security and compliance risks
- Save 10,000 hours annually through reuse
- Foster an innovation culture where knowledge is shared"

**The Hook (30 seconds):**
"This isn't just about efficiency—**Pfizer launched their marketplace in Q4 2025 and we're at risk of falling behind**. Plus, FDA guidance on AI governance is coming, and we need to be ready."

    R1 --> N1
    
    style I1 fill:#FFB6C1
    style R1 fill:#90EE90
    style N1 fill:#FFD700
```

### Value Breakdown

| **Value Source** | **Annual Impact** | **How We Measure** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Time Savings** | $750K | 10,000 hours × $75/hour (tracked via analytics) |
| **Cost Avoidance** | $200K | Eliminated duplicate development (before/after comparison) |
| **Reduced External Spend** | $100K | Fewer external tools & consulting (procurement data) |
| **Security Benefits** | $50K | Risk reduction & incident prevention (actuarial) |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,100K** | **Measurable, tracked monthly** |

### Key Talking Points

**The Investment (30 seconds):**
"We're asking for **$500K in Year 1**, dropping to $450K annually thereafter. This covers:
- A lean core team (5 people)
- Cloud infrastructure
- Security tools
- Training and support

That's **$2.3M over 5 years**—less than what competitors are spending."

**The Return (30 seconds):**
"We'll generate **$1.1M in value annually** through:
- **Time savings**: 10,000 hours we're currently wasting
- **Cost avoidance**: Stopping duplicate work
- **Risk reduction**: Preventing security incidents

All measurable and tracked monthly."

**The Bottom Line (30 seconds):**
"**120% ROI in Year 1. 6-month payback. $5.9M net benefit over 5 years.**

Even in our conservative scenario—if we only hit 50% of targets—we still get positive ROI. This is a low-risk, high-return investment."

## Slide 4: Why Now? Competitive & Regulatory Urgency (90 seconds)

```mermaid
timeline
    title Industry Timeline
    Q4 2025 : Pfizer launches marketplace<br/>2,000+ users in 3 months
    Q1 2026 : FDA draft guidance on AI<br/>Governance requirements
    Q2 2026 : Novartis pilot launch<br/>$600K investment
    Q3 2026 : AZ Decision Point<br/>Lead or follow?
    2027 : Industry standard<br/>Leaders established
```

### Three Reasons We Can't Wait

**1. Competitive Pressure**
- ✅ Pfizer already launched (Q4 2025)
- ✅ Novartis piloting (Q2 2026)
- 🔴 We risk falling behind key competitors

**2. Regulatory Requirements**
- ✅ FDA draft guidance (Jan 2026): AI governance required
- ✅ EMA mandates audit trails (2027)
- 🔴 Compliance gap growing

**3. Current State Costs**
- ✅ $2M wasted annually on duplication
- ✅ Security incidents increasing
- 🔴 Every month we delay costs $170K+

### Key Talking Points

**Competitive Context (30 seconds):**
"**Pfizer launched their marketplace in Q4 2025**—they're already seeing 40% productivity gains. Novartis is piloting. We're at a decision point: **lead or follow?**

If we approve today, we can launch in 6 months and be in the leading group. If we wait, we'll be playing catch-up for years."

**Regulatory Pressure (30 seconds):**
"The FDA released draft guidance in January requiring documented AI governance for drug development. The EMA is mandating audit trails by 2027. **This isn't optional anymore**—it's a regulatory requirement.

We can be proactive and build this right, or reactive and scramble under pressure."

**Cost of Delay (30 seconds):**
"Every month we delay costs us **$170K in wasted effort and risk exposure**. That's $1M over 6 months—**twice the cost of just building the solution**.

Plus, if we have a security incident (which becomes more likely every day), remediation costs $250K+. **The status quo is actually the most expensive option.**"

## Slide 5: Implementation & Risk (90 seconds)

### 12-Month Phased Approach

    section Phase 4
    Optimize & Scale       :2026-10-01, 90d
```

### Risk Mitigation

| **Risk** | **Mitigation** | **Status** |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Security Breach** | Multi-layer scanning + manual review | ✅ Low probability |
| **Low Adoption** | Pilot validation + change management | ✅ Proven approach |
| **Budget Overrun** | Phased gates + monthly reviews | ✅ Controlled |
| **Compliance Issues** | Legal review + validation workflow | ✅ Built-in |

### Key Talking Points

**Proven Approach (30 seconds):**
"We're using a **phased, gate-based approach**:
- **Months 1-3**: Build foundation and core platform
- **Months 4-6**: Pilot with 500 users—prove value before scaling
- **Months 7-9**: Organization-wide rollout
- **Months 10-12**: Optimize based on real usage

This minimizes risk—we validate at each phase before proceeding."

**Risk Management (30 seconds):**
"We've identified the top risks and have mitigation strategies:
- **Security**: Multi-layer scanning plus manual review by CISO team
- **Adoption**: Pilot proves value first, plus comprehensive change management
- **Budget**: Monthly financial reviews with 10% contingency buffer
- **Compliance**: Legal and compliance teams involved from day one

**The biggest risk is actually NOT doing this**—continued waste and exposure."

**Resource Requirements (30 seconds):**
"We need a lean core team:
- 1 Product Owner
- 1 Technical Lead
- 2 Developers
- Part-time security and community support

We're leveraging existing AZ infrastructure and tools where possible. **This is a strategic investment in internal capability, not an external dependency.**"

We're ready to move. We need your approval on three things: budget, sponsor, and hiring authority.

**Pfizer is ahead. Regulations are coming. Every month costs $170K.**

Can I answer any questions?"

### Handling Common Questions

**Q: "Why not just use Claude's native features?"**
**A:** "Good question. Claude's features are great for individuals, but they don't provide the security scanning, compliance validation, or organizational governance we need for pharmaceutical operations. We'd still have the same risks and waste. Plus, we'd be dependent on Anthropic's roadmap rather than controlling our own destiny."

**Q: "Can we start smaller?"**
**A:** "We could, but the pilot IS our 'start small' approach—500 users for 2 months before scaling. Going smaller than that won't give us meaningful data. Plus, the fixed costs (team, infrastructure) don't scale down much, so we'd get worse ROI."

**Q: "What if adoption is lower than expected?"**
**A:** "Great question—we've modeled that. Even at 50% of target adoption, we still get positive ROI. And our pilot phase specifically validates adoption before we scale. If the pilot doesn't work, we can pause and adjust."

**Q: "How does this compare to what competitors are doing?"**
**A:** "Pfizer invested similar amounts and is seeing 40% productivity gains. Novartis is investing $600K—more than us. We're actually being more cost-effective by leveraging existing AZ infrastructure. The real risk is NOT doing this and falling behind."

**Q: "What's the ongoing commitment after Year 1?"**
**A:** "Costs drop to $450K annually in Years 2-5 as the platform matures. But value continues to grow as adoption increases—we project $1.35M in Year 2, $1.65M in Year 3. The ROI gets better over time."
