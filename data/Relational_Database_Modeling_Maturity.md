### Contact & Follow-up

**For questions or to schedule an assessment, please reach out to your data architecture team or AI/ML center of excellence.**

**Remember**: Database maturity for AI is a journey, not a destination. Start with normalization fundamentals, prioritize by AI impact, and improve continuously.

**Key Takeaway**: Proper normalization isn't just good practice—it's essential for LLM reasoning accuracy and reducing hallucinations by 40-70%.
