## Neuroimmune psychiatric insights
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer treatment but often trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including neuroimmune and neuropsychiatric side effects, due to the loss of self-tolerance. These side effects, occurring in roughly 1%–12% of patients, provide crucial insights into neuroimmunology, helping researchers identify new targets for psychiatric disorders. 
Neuroimmune Psychiatric Side Effects of Checkpoint Inhibitors
ICIs—particularly anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab)—can induce a range of Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) toxicities. 
Psychiatric Manifestations: These represent 2.7% of ICI-related reports, often presenting as acute confusion (17%), insomnia (12%), anxiety (9%), depression (8%), and delirium (7%).
Autoimmune Encephalitis: A rare but severe complication (13% of neurological irAEs) characterized by altered mental status, cognitive impairment, and behavioral changes, frequently associated with antibodies against synaptic receptors (e.g., NMDA) or neuronal proteins (e.g., Ma2, Hu).
Other Neuroimmune Events: Aseptic meningitis, demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Transverse Myelitis), and peripheral neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).
Mechanism: Increased T-cell activation disrupts immune tolerance, leading to cytokine production (IL-6, IL-17, TNF-
α
𝛼
) that breaks down the blood-brain barrier. 
Strategies to Find New Targets in Neuroimmune Psychiatry
The study of these side effects provides a "natural experiment" to identify molecular targets for treating neuropsychiatric conditions, particularly those involving low-grade chronic inflammation, such as treatment-resistant depression or autoimmune-related psychosis. 
Exploiting Immune Profiles:
IL-6 and IL-1 Target: Elevated IL-6 and IL-1 in patients with ICI-induced neurotoxicity suggests that inhibition of these cytokine pathways (e.g., tocilizumab) could be used to treat neuroinflammatory psychiatric symptoms.
Immune Checkpoint Modulation: Studying how PD-1/CTLA-4 impacts microglial activation and neuroinflammation can guide the development of microglia-targeting drugs for neurodegenerative and psychiatric illnesses.
Identifying Synaptic-Related Pathways:
NOTCH Signaling: Research using FAERS data has linked ICI-induced psychiatric adverse events to disruptions in NOTCH signaling pathways and synaptic adhesion-like molecules (neurexins, neuroligins), offering new avenues for treating cognitive dysfunction.
Preclinical Modeling:
Tumor-Induced Behavioral Models: Using animal models to study how immune activation causes sickness behavior (fatigue, anhedonia, anxiety) helps isolate specific inflammatory markers as targets for therapy.
Alzheimer’s Disease Research: The ability of PD-1 inhibition to increase cerebral amyloid plaque clearance in mouse models suggests that immune checkpoint modulation could be a target for neurodegenerative disorders.
Neurotransmitter/Immune System Interactions:
IDO Inhibitors: Combining Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors with immunotherapy to modulate the tumor microenvironment may reveal links between kynurenine pathway dysfunction and mood disorders.
Antidepressant Anti-inflammatory Effects: Investigating why certain antidepressants (e.g., tricyclics, SSRIs) help alleviate ICI-induced neurotoxicity by modulating T-cell responses.
Genetic Susceptibility Mapping:
HLA Typing: Identifying HLA variants (e.g., DRB1) associated with neurological toxicities allows for the identification of patients prone to neuroimmune conditions and helps map the genetic landscape of immune-related psychiatric disorders. 
Key Findings: The onset of these symptoms is often rapid (within 2–12 weeks of initiation), and they can, in some cases, be reversed by withdrawing the drug or administering immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids), highlighting the direct immune-mediated nature of the damage.
