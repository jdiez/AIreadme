# Detailed Simulation Protocol: Uncovering Hidden Needs in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

Let me create a comprehensive, executable protocol using DMD as our case study—a progressive rare disease affecting approximately 1 in 3,500-5,000 male births, with complex caregiver dynamics and multi-stage disease progression.

## Protocol Setup: DMD Hidden Needs Discovery

### Phase 1: Knowledge Base Architecture

#### Data Collection Framework

**Primary Sources to Input:**

**Patient & Caregiver Voices:**
- Parent Advocacy Forum Archives (Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, CureDuchenne forums)
- Reddit communities (r/MuscularDystrophy, rare disease subreddits)
- Facebook support groups (anonymized, aggregated sentiment data)
- YouTube family vlogs and testimonials
- Patient blogs tracking disease progression

**Clinical & Research Context:**
- Natural history studies and quality of life assessments
- Clinical trial enrollment and retention data
- Transition of care studies (pediatric to adult care)
- Psychosocial burden literature
- Healthcare utilization patterns

**Ecosystem Intelligence:**
- School accommodation requests and IEP documentation patterns
- Disability benefits application narratives
- Medical equipment procurement timelines
- Home modification decision points

#### Agent Configuration

**Agent 1: "The Unspoken Burden Detector"**

**Role**: Identify emotional and psychological needs that families minimize or normalize

**Training Focus:**
- Language patterns indicating learned helplessness
- Minimization phrases ("it could be worse," "we're managing")
- Guilt expressions from mothers, fathers, siblings
- Identity loss in caregivers
- Anticipatory grief markers
- Sibling neglect indicators

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Analyze patient/caregiver narratives for:
1. Emotional needs expressed indirectly through questions about others
2. Self-care abandonment signals
3. Relationship strain mentioned casually
4. Dreams/aspirations discussed in past tense
5. Comparison to "normal" families with resignation tone
```

**Agent 2: "The Transition Crisis Mapper"**

**Role**: Identify critical inflection points where support systems fail

**Training Focus:**
- Diagnosis disclosure trauma
- Loss of ambulation transition
- Ventilation initiation decision paralysis
- School transition challenges (elementary → middle → high school)
- Pediatric to adult care handoff
- Young adult independence vs. dependency tensions
- End-of-life planning avoidance

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Map patient journey for:
1. Transitions mentioned with high anxiety/avoidance language
2. Information gaps at critical decision points
3. Regret expressions about past transitions
4. Preparation activities that families wish they'd started earlier
5. Support that "disappeared" at certain stages
```

**Agent 3: "The Social Isolation Analyst"**

**Role**: Detect hidden social and community disconnection

**Training Focus:**
- Friendship loss patterns as disease progresses
- Family event participation decline
- Social media engagement changes
- Peer relationship quality for patients
- Caregiver social network erosion
- Dating and intimacy topics for adolescents/young adults
- Employment discrimination or career limitation signals

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Identify patterns of:
1. Activities mentioned as "used to do" without explicit grief
2. Invitations declined with medical excuses (masking social anxiety)
3. Isolation framed as preference or practical necessity
4. Loneliness expressed through online community over-engagement
5. Identity construction around disease vs. personhood
```

**Agent 4: "The Financial Toxicity Investigator"**

**Role**: Uncover hidden financial strain and resource allocation dilemmas

**Training Focus:**
- Medical bankruptcy risk indicators
- Treatment non-adherence due to cost (rarely admitted directly)
- Caregiver workforce exit patterns
- Sibling opportunity costs (college, activities)
- Relationship strain from financial stress
- Equipment/modification delays rationalized as "not urgent yet"

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Detect signals of:
1. Treatment decisions influenced by cost but attributed to other factors
2. Delayed equipment procurement despite clear need
3. Caregiver employment sacrifices minimized as "choice"
4. Fundraising fatigue or shame
5. Resource allocation guilt between affected child and siblings
```

**Agent 5: "The Clinical Care Gap Finder"**

**Role**: Identify unmet medical needs patients have normalized

**Training Focus:**
- Pain management inadequacy
- Sleep disruption acceptance
- Respiratory symptom minimization
- Gastrointestinal issues dismissed as "minor"
- Mental health needs unaddressed
- Preventive care neglect due to rare disease focus
- Provider communication failures

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Flag instances where patients/families:
1. Describe symptoms as "just part of DMD" that might be treatable
2. Express surprise when others don't experience certain issues
3. Mention symptoms only in passing or as context for other topics
4. Describe workarounds for problems that might have medical solutions
5. Report provider dismissiveness of "secondary" concerns
```

**Agent 6: "The Future Self Disconnect Detector"**

**Role**: Identify planning paralysis and anticipatory needs

**Training Focus:**
- Advance care planning avoidance
- Transition planning procrastination
- Hope vs. realism tension
- Information avoidance about later disease stages
- Equipment/modification resistance despite future need
- Educational/vocational planning gaps

**Prompt Framework:**
```
Analyze for:
1. Future-oriented questions that go unasked
2. Planning activities described as "not ready yet" repeatedly
3. Surprise at disease progression despite predictable trajectory
4. Regret about late preparation
5. Tension between maintaining hope and practical planning
```

## Phase 2: Simulation Execution

### Scenario 1: The Diagnosis-to-Acceptance Journey

**Objective**: Uncover hidden needs in the first 24 months post-diagnosis

**Simulation Design:**

Create synthetic personas representing:
- **Persona A**: Mother, primary caregiver, 4-year-old son newly diagnosed, has 2-year-old daughter
- **Persona B**: Father, working full-time, struggling with diagnosis acceptance
- **Persona C**: Maternal grandmother, involved in care, pre-internet generation
- **Persona D**: 4-year-old patient (represented through parent observations)

**Agent Tasks:**

1. **Simulate forum interactions** between these personas over 24 months
2. **Track language evolution** from diagnosis shock to adaptation
3. **Identify questions asked repeatedly** without satisfactory answers
4. **Map information-seeking patterns** and what searches are abandoned
5. **Detect topics avoided** in public forums but implied through indirect questions

**Expected Hidden Needs to Surface:**

- Grief processing resources that don't feel like "giving up hope"
- How to tell extended family without being overwhelmed by pity
- Managing guilt about genetic transmission
- When/how to tell the child about prognosis
- Balancing attention between affected child and siblings
- Navigating marital strain without admitting "the diagnosis is hurting our marriage"
- Finding meaning and purpose after life plans shatter

**Validation Approach:**

Run the simulation, extract top 10 hidden needs, then create a targeted survey for newly diagnosed families through patient organizations asking: "Which of these did you wish someone had addressed earlier?" Rate resonance 1-10.

### Scenario 2: The Loss of Ambulation Transition

**Objective**: Identify hidden emotional and practical needs during wheelchair transition

**Simulation Design:**

Model the 6-month period before and after full-time wheelchair use for:
- **Persona E**: 9-year-old boy, aware of disease progression, anxious about peer perception
- **Persona F**: Mother, grieving mobility loss, guilty about relief that wheelchair reduces fall risk
- **Persona G**: 12-year-old sister, embarrassed by brother's wheelchair at school events
- **Persona H**: School nurse, well-meaning but inexperienced with progressive conditions

**Agent Tasks:**

1. **Simulate family conversations** about wheelchair timing decision
2. **Model peer interactions** at school before/after wheelchair
3. **Track emotional language** around mobility aids
4. **Identify decision delays** and rationalizations
5. **Detect identity reconstruction** attempts

**Expected Hidden Needs to Surface:**

- Permission to grieve mobility loss while celebrating continued participation
- How to help child maintain social status during visible disability transition
- Managing sibling embarrassment without invalidating their feelings
- Timing wheelchair introduction to minimize trauma (summer break? gradual?)
- Addressing patient's internalized ableism
- Redefining masculinity and independence for young boys
- Managing parental guilt about "giving in" to wheelchair

**Intervention Testing:**

Simulate responses to different support interventions:
- **Intervention A**: Peer mentorship program (teen DMD patients in wheelchairs)
- **Intervention B**: Family therapy focused on anticipatory grief
- **Intervention C**: "Wheelchair graduation" celebration reframing
- **Intervention D**: Sibling-specific support groups

Analyze which interventions reduce anxiety markers and increase acceptance language in simulations.

### Scenario 3: The Young Adult Independence Paradox

**Objective**: Uncover hidden needs around autonomy, identity, and relationships for teens/young adults

**Simulation Design:**

Model experiences of:
- **Persona I**: 17-year-old DMD patient, cognitively intact, physically dependent, interested in dating
- **Persona J**: Mother, struggling to allow age-appropriate risk-taking
- **Persona K**: Father, worried about son's future employment and purpose
- **Persona L**: 19-year-old girlfriend, navigating relationship with progressive disability

**Agent Tasks:**

1. **Simulate online dating profile creation** and messaging
2. **Model parent-teen conflicts** around independence
3. **Track language around sexuality and intimacy** (likely heavily euphemistic)
4. **Identify career/education planning gaps**
5. **Detect self-worth and purpose construction** attempts

**Expected Hidden Needs to Surface:**

- Sexuality and intimacy education appropriate for physical limitations
- How to date when physically dependent on parents for care
- Navigating caregiver boundaries as patient becomes adult
- Finding purpose and identity beyond "DMD patient"
- Managing parental over-protection without damaging relationship
- Addressing depression and suicidal ideation (often minimized)
- Practical independence skills despite physical dependence
- Peer relationships with able-bodied young adults

**Deep Dive Analysis:**

Have agents specifically analyze:
- **What questions about relationships/sexuality are asked anonymously vs. publicly?**
- **How do young adults describe their future when asked directly vs. in casual conversation?**
- **What topics generate the most emotional intensity but shortest discussions?** (avoidance signal)
- **How does language differ between patient self-advocacy and parent advocacy?**

### Scenario 4: The Caregiver Identity Crisis

**Objective**: Identify hidden needs of primary caregivers (typically mothers) whose identity becomes consumed by caregiving

**Simulation Design:**

Model 5-year longitudinal journey:
- **Persona M**: Mother who left career at diagnosis, now 8 years into caregiving
- **Persona N**: Father who maintained career, feels guilty and disconnected
- **Persona O**: Respite care worker who sees caregiver burnout
- **Persona P**: Caregiver's sister, worried about her sibling's wellbeing

**Agent Tasks:**

1. **Track self-referential language evolution** ("I" statements about non-caregiving identity)
2. **Identify hobbies/interests mentioned in past tense**
3. **Detect resentment signals** quickly corrected or minimized
4. **Map social network contraction patterns**
5. **Analyze help-seeking vs. help-refusing language**

**Expected Hidden Needs to Surface:**

- Permission to have negative feelings without being "bad parent"
- Identity reconstruction beyond "DMD mom"
- Respite care without guilt or anxiety
- Relationship maintenance with spouse as partners, not just co-caregivers
- Career re-entry pathways that accommodate caregiving
- Grief for the life/career they didn't have
- Fear of what happens to child if caregiver becomes ill/dies
- Resentment toward able-bodied children's "normal" problems

**Simulation Experiment:**

Create two parallel simulations:
- **Simulation A**: Caregiver with strong support system and respite
- **Simulation B**: Caregiver with minimal support (more common reality)

Compare language patterns, emotional markers, and coping strategies. Identify which specific support elements create the most significant difference in wellbeing indicators.

## Phase 3: Cross-Pattern Analysis

### Meta-Analysis Across All Scenarios

**Agent Ensemble Task**: Identify themes that appear across multiple scenarios but are never directly addressed

**Synthesis Questions:**

1. **What needs appear in 4+ scenarios but are never explicitly requested?**
2. **Which demographic segments (fathers, siblings, patients themselves) have the most unvoiced needs?**
3. **What life stages have the largest gap between expected needs and expressed needs?**
4. **Which needs generate the most emotional intensity when mentioned tangentially?**
5. **What workarounds do families create that signal unmet needs?**

**Expected Cross-Cutting Hidden Needs:**

**Anticipatory Grief Support**: Families grieve continuously but have no framework for "grieving someone who's still alive" without feeling they're giving up hope

**Sibling Psychological Support**: Siblings experience trauma, guilt, resentment, and neglect but their needs are systematically deprioritized

**Marital Relationship Preservation**: Couples need support as romantic partners, not just co-caregivers, but this feels "selfish" to request

**Meaning-Making and Purpose**: Families need help constructing meaning from suffering without toxic positivity or religious frameworks that may not fit

**Permission for Negative Emotions**: Families need explicit permission to feel anger, resentment, grief, and frustration without being labeled as "not coping well"

**Practical Independence Skills**: Patients need life skills training that acknowledges physical limitations while maximizing autonomy

**End-of-Life Planning Without Despair**: Families need advance care planning support that doesn't feel like "planning to die"

**Financial Planning Beyond Fundraising**: Families need sophisticated financial planning for lifetime care costs, not just crisis fundraising

## Phase 4: Solution Concept Development & Testing

### Intervention Design Workshop

For each identified hidden need, use agents to simulate solution concepts:

#### Example: Addressing Anticipatory Grief

**Solution Concept A**: "Living Grief" support groups specifically for parents of children with terminal diagnoses

**Simulation Test:**
- Model parent reactions to invitation to join
- Simulate first meeting dynamics
- Track language evolution over 6 simulated sessions
- Identify resistance points and engagement drivers

**Solution Concept B**: Narrative therapy approach helping families construct "dual storylines"—hope for treatment advances AND preparation for disease progression

**Simulation Test:**
- Model therapy sessions with Persona A & B (parents from Scenario 1)
- Analyze anxiety reduction vs. increased distress
- Identify which families benefit most vs. find it unhelpful

**Solution Concept C**: Peer mentorship matching newly diagnosed families with families 2-3 years ahead

**Simulation Test:**
- Model mentor-mentee conversations
- Identify topics mentees are comfortable asking peers vs. clinicians
- Detect potential mentor burnout or boundary issues
- Optimize matching criteria (disease stage, family structure, values)

#### Example: Addressing Young Adult Independence Paradox

**Solution Concept A**: "Adulting with DMD" program teaching practical independence skills (financial management, directing caregivers, advocacy, relationship skills)

**Simulation Test:**
- Model young adult engagement with different program formats (online, in-person, peer-led)
- Identify which skills generate most interest vs. avoidance
- Test parent involvement levels (separate parent track? joint sessions?)

**Solution Concept B**: Supported dating/relationship platform for young adults with disabilities

**Simulation Test:**
- Model profile creation and matching
- Identify privacy concerns and stigma barriers
- Test different platform features (video chat accessibility, caregiver coordination tools)
- Analyze safety considerations

**Solution Concept C**: Transition planning that explicitly addresses sexuality, relationships, and intimacy

**Simulation Test:**
- Model patient and parent comfort levels with different discussion formats
- Identify optimal timing for introduction (age, disease stage)
- Test different facilitators (clinician, therapist, peer educator)

### Prioritization Framework

**Score each hidden need on:**

**Impact Severity** (1-10): How significantly does this unmet need affect quality of life?

**Prevalence** (1-10): What percentage of DMD families experience this?

**Current Gap** (1-10): How poorly is this need currently addressed by existing resources?

**AZ Addressability** (1-10): How well-positioned is AstraZeneca to address this need?

**Competitive Whitespace** (1-10): How differentiated would AZ's approach be?

**Evidence Strength** (1-10): How confident are we that this is a genuine hidden need based on simulation data?

### Example Prioritization Output

| Hidden Need | Impact | Prevalence | Gap | AZ Fit | Whitespace | Evidence | **Total** |
|-------------|--------|------------|-----|--------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Anticipatory Grief Support | 9 | 10 | 9 | 6 | 7 | 9 | **50** |
| Sibling Psychological Support | 8 | 9 | 10 | 5 | 8 | 8 | **48** |
| Young Adult Independence | 9 | 7 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 8 | **49** |
| Caregiver Identity Crisis | 9 | 10 | 8 | 6 | 6 | 9 | **48** |
| Financial Planning Beyond Fundraising | 7 | 10 | 7 | 4 | 5 | 7 | **40** |

## Phase 5: Validation & Refinement

### Real-World Validation Protocol

**Step 1: Qualitative Validation**

Conduct 15-20 in-depth interviews with DMD families, structured around:
- "We've heard some families experience [hidden need]. Does this resonate with your experience?"
- "On a scale of 1-10, how important would addressing [hidden need] be to you?"
- "What have you tried to address this? What worked? What didn't?"
- "If someone offered [solution concept], would you participate? What concerns would you have?"

**Step 2: Survey Validation**

Deploy survey through patient organizations (n=200-300):
- List 15-20 identified hidden needs without labeling them as "hidden"
- Ask: "How much has this been a challenge for your family?" (1-5 scale)
- Ask: "How well has this need been addressed by current resources?" (1-5 scale)
- Calculate "unmet need score" (challenge level - resource adequacy)

**Step 3: Co-Design Workshops**

Invite 8-10 families to workshop sessions:
- Present top 5 hidden needs and solution concepts
- Facilitate co-design of interventions
- Identify implementation barriers
- Refine based on lived experience

### Iterative Refinement

**Feed validation data back into the playground:**

1. **Adjust agent prompts** based on which hidden needs validated most strongly
2. **Refine solution concepts** based on patient feedback
3. **Run new simulations** testing refined interventions
4. **Identify second-order hidden needs** that emerge once primary needs are addressed

## Phase 6: Implementation Roadmap

### Pilot Program Design

**Select 2-3 highest-priority hidden needs for pilot interventions**

**Example: Anticipatory Grief Support Pilot**

**Program Design:**
- 8-week facilitated support group for parents
- Separate concurrent group for patients (age-appropriate)
- Narrative therapy framework
- Peer mentorship component
- Online community for ongoing support

**Success Metrics:**
- Psychological distress reduction (validated scales)
- Marital satisfaction improvement
- Treatment adherence maintenance
- Quality of life scores
- Program satisfaction and retention
- Qualitative feedback on "permission to grieve"

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Clinical oversight for mental health crises
- Opt-out flexibility without stigma
- Cultural adaptation for diverse families
- Accessibility for non-English speakers, rural families

### Continuous Learning Loop

**Establish feedback mechanisms:**

1. **Quarterly simulation updates** with new patient voice data
2. **Pilot program data fed back into agent training**
3. **Emerging needs monitoring** as disease landscape changes (new therapies, longer lifespans)
4. **Cross-disease application** of successful approaches to other rare diseases

## Ethical Considerations & Safeguards

### Privacy Protection

- All simulation data must be de-identified and aggregated
- Patient organization partnerships require transparent data use agreements
- Opt-in consent for any direct patient engagement
- Secure data handling compliant with regional regulations

### Avoiding Exploitation

- Validate that solutions enhance autonomy, not create dependencies
- Ensure interventions are accessible regardless of ability to pay
- Avoid creating needs where none exist
- Maintain focus on patient benefit, not commercial opportunity

### Cultural Sensitivity

- Recognize that "hidden needs" may be culturally specific
- Adapt interventions for diverse populations
- Avoid imposing Western psychological frameworks universally
- Partner with culturally specific patient organizations

### Transparency

- Be clear about AI involvement in needs detection
- Share findings with patient community for validation
- Credit patient voices as co-creators of insights
- Publish learnings to benefit broader rare disease community
