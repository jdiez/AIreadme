# Proposal: AI Agentic Playground for Rare Disease Patient-Centric Market Research

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of an **AI Agentic Playground** specifically designed for rare disease research, where AI agents dynamically impersonate and embody different stakeholder roles—from patients living with rare conditions to patient advocates, patient organization representatives, and AstraZeneca employees across functions. This multi-perspective simulation environment will enable AstraZeneca to navigate the unique complexities of rare disease research, where patient populations are small, geographically dispersed, and often underrepresented in traditional research.

**Strategic Value**: Rare diseases affect approximately 400 million people globally, yet each individual condition may have only hundreds or thousands of patients worldwide. This AI agentic framework will enable AstraZeneca to conduct comprehensive stakeholder research at scale, reducing dependency on limited patient availability while accelerating insights that inform orphan drug development, clinical trial design, and patient support programs.

## The Rare Disease Research Challenge

### Unique Complexities

**Patient Scarcity & Access**
- Individual rare diseases may have only 500-5,000 patients globally
- Patients are geographically dispersed, making traditional focus groups impractical
- Recruiting for Patient Advisory Boards can take 6-12 months
- Patient fatigue from over-research in small communities

**Multi-Stakeholder Ecosystem**
- Patient organizations often serve as gatekeepers and trusted intermediaries
- Advocates bring lived experience but may not represent all patient perspectives
- Healthcare providers have limited experience with any single rare disease
- AZ teams must coordinate across R&D, medical affairs, market access, and patient engagement

**Information Asymmetry**
- Patients often know more about their condition than many physicians
- Patient organizations possess deep historical knowledge and community insights
- Natural history data is limited, making patient journey mapping challenging
- Unmet needs are poorly documented in medical literature

**Regulatory & Commercial Complexity**
- Orphan drug designations require demonstrated patient benefit
- Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies demand patient relevance evidence
- Reimbursement decisions hinge on patient-reported quality of life improvements
- Patient advocacy groups influence policy and funding decisions

## Framework Architecture & Mechanics

### Agent Generation Process

**1. Role Definition & Parameterization**
- User specifies stakeholder role(s) to simulate
- System retrieves role-specific knowledge base and behavioral templates
- Agent is instantiated with realistic constraints, motivations, and communication patterns

**2. Contextual Grounding**
- Agent receives disease-specific information (epidemiology, treatment landscape, unmet needs)
- Historical interactions and community dynamics are incorporated
- Current events and policy environment are factored in

**3. Persona Refinement**
- Demographic and psychographic variables are assigned (age, disease duration, geography, socioeconomic status)
- Specific experiences and perspectives are generated (treatment history, advocacy involvement)
- Relationship networks are established (which other agents this role typically interacts with)

### Interaction Modes

**Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation**
- Agents engage in realistic conversations representing stakeholder meetings
- Example: Patient Advisory Board simulation with patient agents, advocate agents, and AZ employee agents
- Captures authentic dynamics, power imbalances, and communication challenges

**Sequential Stakeholder Consultation**
- User poses research questions to different agent roles sequentially
- Each agent responds from their unique perspective
- System synthesizes cross-stakeholder insights and identifies alignment/tensions

**Scenario Planning & War Gaming**
- Agents respond to hypothetical situations (e.g., trial design changes, pricing decisions, regulatory setbacks)
- Reveals potential stakeholder reactions before real-world implementation
- Identifies risk mitigation strategies and communication approaches

**Patient Journey Co-Creation**
- Patient agents narrate their journey while advocate and patient organization agents provide context
- AZ employee agents identify intervention opportunities and support needs
- System generates comprehensive journey maps with multi-stakeholder annotations

**Debate & Deliberation Forums**
- Agents representing different perspectives debate contentious issues
- Example: Placebo-controlled trial ethics, compassionate use criteria, patient registry data sharing
- Surfaces ethical considerations and stakeholder priorities

## Use Cases & Applications

### 1. Clinical Trial Protocol Optimization

**Scenario**: Designing a Phase 3 trial for an ultra-rare metabolic disorder with ~800 patients globally.

**Agentic Simulation**:

**Patient Agents** (Newly Diagnosed, Experienced, Pediatric Parent):
- Newly Diagnosed: "I'm still trying to understand my diagnosis. A 24-month trial feels overwhelming when I don't know what the next year holds."
- Experienced: "I've been in three trials already. The monthly visits are manageable, but the invasive procedures need strong justification."
- Pediatric Parent: "Missing school for study visits is a huge burden. Can we do some assessments remotely or during school breaks?"

**Patient Organization Representative Agent**:
- "Our registry shows 60% of patients live more than 100 miles from specialized centers. Decentralized trial elements are essential for enrollment."

**Clinical Development Lead Agent**:
- "We need to balance patient burden with regulatory requirements for in-person assessments. Let's explore home nursing visits for routine procedures."

**Regulatory Affairs Agent**:
- "FDA has accepted remote assessments for similar rare diseases if we validate the measures. We should document patient preference data to support this approach."

**Synthesis**:
- Protocol modified to include hybrid design with quarterly in-person visits and monthly telehealth check-ins
- Home nursing for blood draws implemented in collaboration with patient organization
- Patient burden reduced by 40% while maintaining regulatory acceptability
- Estimated enrollment timeline reduced from 18 months to 12 months

### 2. Patient Support Program Design

**Scenario**: Developing comprehensive patient support for a newly approved rare neuromuscular therapy.

**Agentic Simulation**:

**Patient Agents** (Multiple Personas):
- End-Stage Patient: "I need help navigating insurance denials quickly. Every month matters to me."
- Experienced Patient: "I want peer mentoring—talking to someone who's been through this is more valuable than any brochure."
- Pediatric Parent: "Financial assistance is critical, but so is connecting with other parents who understand the school accommodation battles."

**Grassroots Advocate Agent**:
- "Our community has created informal support networks. Partner with us rather than duplicating—we know what patients actually need."

**Large Organization Executive Agent**:
- "We can help with patient identification and education, but the support program must be sustainable and not just a launch tactic."

**Patient Engagement Lead Agent** (AZ):
- "Let's co-create this program with patient organizations rather than designing it internally and seeking endorsement later."

**Market Access Agent** (AZ):
- "Reimbursement support is table stakes, but we should also address non-financial barriers like care coordination and specialist access."

**Synthesis**:
- Co-designed support program with three-tier approach: reimbursement navigation, peer mentoring (through patient organization partnership), care coordination
- Patient organization receives sustainable funding for peer support program they already operate
- AZ provides training and resources but doesn't control patient-to-patient interactions
- Program includes caregiver support and educational resources developed with patient input
- Projected adherence improvement of 25-30% based on addressing holistic patient needs

---

### 3. Regulatory Submission Patient Voice Integration

**Scenario**: Preparing FDA submission for orphan drug designation with robust patient perspective documentation.

**Agentic Simulation**:

**Patient Agents** (Cross-Section of Disease Stages):
- Multiple agents describe daily functional limitations, emotional impact, social isolation, financial burden
- Agents articulate what treatment success means to them (not just clinical biomarkers)

**Patient-Researcher Advocate Agent**:
- "The primary endpoint should be functional capacity, not just enzyme levels. Patients care about what they can do, not lab values."

**Small Foundation Leader Agent**:
- "Our natural history study shows disease progression is highly variable. The trial should stratify by genotype to capture meaningful subgroup effects."

**Regulatory Affairs Agent** (AZ):
- "We need to document patient input on endpoint selection and demonstrate that our primary outcome is meaningful to patients' daily lives."

**Medical Affairs Agent** (AZ):
- "Let's conduct patient preference studies to quantify the relative importance of different treatment benefits and risks."

**Synthesis**:
- Comprehensive patient perspective document compiled from multi-agent insights
- Primary endpoint justified through patient-reported importance data
- Secondary endpoints include patient-identified quality of life measures
- Risk-benefit framework aligned with patient priorities (e.g., patients willing to accept higher side effect burden for functional improvement)
- Submission includes patient organization letters of support generated through authentic engagement process
- FDA grants orphan designation with expedited review based on strong patient needs documentation

---

### 4. Ethical Dilemma Navigation: Placebo-Controlled Trial in Fatal Disease

**Scenario**: Regulators require placebo-controlled trial for rare fatal disease where standard of care is supportive only.

**Agentic Debate**:

**End-Stage Patient Agent**:
- "I'm dying. Giving me a placebo for 12 months is a death sentence. I'd rather take my chances with an unproven drug than nothing."

**Experienced Patient Agent**:
- "We need good data or we'll end up with another ineffective therapy. I'd participate in a placebo trial if there's a guaranteed crossover after 6 months."

**Professional Advocate Agent**:
- "Ethically, we need equipoise. If there's genuine uncertainty about efficacy, a placebo arm is justified, but the trial must be as short as possible."

**Small Foundation Leader Agent**:
- "Our community is divided. Some families are desperate and would try anything. Others want rigorous science. We need a solution that respects both perspectives."

**Clinical Development Lead Agent** (AZ):
- "We could propose a delayed-start design where everyone eventually gets treatment, and we compare early vs. delayed start to demonstrate benefit."

**Regulatory Affairs Agent** (AZ):
- "FDA has accepted delayed-start designs in other rare diseases. We need to demonstrate that the delay doesn't cause irreversible harm."

**Patient Engagement Lead Agent** (AZ):
- "Let's present multiple trial design options to a patient advisory board and let them weigh in on what's ethically acceptable to the community."

**Synthesis**:
- Delayed-start design proposed with 6-month placebo period followed by guaranteed treatment
- Interim analysis at 3 months with option to stop early if clear benefit demonstrated
- Enhanced standard of care provided to placebo group (best supportive care, frequent monitoring)
- Patient advisory board consulted and majority support documented
- Compassionate use program established for patients who don't meet trial eligibility
- Trial design accepted by FDA and community, enrollment completed ahead of schedule due to patient trust

### 5. Market Access Strategy: Demonstrating Value in Ultra-Rare Disease

**Scenario**: Preparing for HTA submissions in Europe for therapy treating ~500 patients annually across EU.

**Agentic Simulation**:

**Patient Agents** (Multiple Personas):
- Agents describe quality of life improvements that matter most: ability to work, reduced hospitalizations, independence in daily activities
- Agents articulate willingness to pay and trade-offs they'd accept

**Large Organization Executive Agent**:
- "Our patient-reported outcome data shows significant improvements in domains that aren't captured by traditional clinical measures."

**Patient Registry Manager Agent**:
- "Real-world evidence from our registry demonstrates sustained benefit over 5+ years, addressing long-term value questions."

**Market Access Agent** (AZ):
- "We need to build a value story around patient-relevant outcomes, not just clinical biomarkers. HTA bodies want to see quality of life data."

**HEOR Agent** (AZ):
- "Let's conduct patient preference studies to quantify the value patients place on specific treatment benefits, then incorporate that into our economic model."

**Medical Affairs Agent** (AZ):
- "We should engage patient organizations early in the HTA process. Their testimony about unmet needs and treatment impact is powerful."

**Synthesis**:
- Comprehensive value dossier developed with patient-centric evidence
- Patient preference study quantifies relative importance of functional improvement vs. side effect burden
- Real-world evidence from patient registry demonstrates long-term benefit and healthcare resource utilization reduction
- Patient organization provides testimony at HTA hearings about community impact
- Economic model incorporates patient-reported productivity gains and caregiver burden reduction
- Positive reimbursement decisions achieved in 8/10 European countries, with patient access programs bridging gaps
