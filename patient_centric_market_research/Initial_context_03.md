## Detailed Use Case Comparisons

### **USE CASE 1: Rare Disease Patient Recruitment for Qualitative Research**

**Scenario**: Pharma company developing treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Need 15 patients + 15 caregivers for in-depth interviews across US and EU.

#### **Option A: Rare Patient Voice (RPV)**

**Strengths**:
- Established DMD patient database (likely 200-400 patients)
- Fast recruitment: 2-3 weeks for US patients
- Experience with rare disease sensitivities
- Direct patient relationships (not intermediaries)

**Weaknesses**:
- Primarily US-focused (limited EU reach)
- Would need partner for EU recruitment
- Less suitable for large quantitative studies

**Timeline**: 
- US patients: 3 weeks
- EU patients: 6-8 weeks (via partners)

**Cost Estimate**:
- US: $300/patient × 15 = $4,500 + $20K project fee = **$24,500**
- EU: $500/patient × 15 = $7,500 + $25K partner fee = **$32,500**
- **Total: $57,000**

**Best For**: US-heavy studies, need for speed, established rare disease

---

#### **Option B: Sago (Global Recruitment)**

**Strengths**:
- Single vendor for US + EU
- 60+ country infrastructure
- Can scale if sample size increases
- Experience with complex logistics

**Weaknesses**:
- Less specialized rare disease database
- Longer recruitment timeline for ultra-rare
- May use third-party rare disease recruiters (adds cost)

**Timeline**: 
- Combined US/EU: 6-8 weeks

**Cost Estimate**:
- $600/patient × 30 = $18,000 + $45K project fee = **$63,000**

**Best For**: Multi-country studies, need for single vendor accountability

---

#### **Option C: Hybrid (RPV + Sago)**

**Strengths**:

---

**RECOMMENDATION**: **Hybrid approach (RPV + Sago)**
- **Rationale**: RPV's rare disease depth for US speed, Sago's infrastructure for EU reliability
- **Risk Mitigation**: Start US recruitment immediately with RPV while Sago sets up EU
- **Cost-Benefit**: Marginal cost increase ($2,500) justified by 3-week faster US insights

**Total Timeline**: 13 weeks

**Total Cost**: **$180,000**

**Rationale**: 
- Data-driven prioritization prevents wasting qualitative research on wrong segments
- Behavioral insights are segment-specific and actionable
- Quantitative + qualitative = compelling internal business case

- **Clinical Integration**: Syneos works directly with clinical ops, ensuring recommendations are implemented
- **Speed to Impact**: Established consortium means faster convening than recruiting patients from scratch

**Expected Outcomes**:
- Reduce clinic visits from 15 to 10-12 (based on patient feedback)
- Modify 2-3 inclusion/exclusion criteria that are unnecessarily restrictive
- Implement remote monitoring for 3-4 assessments
- **Projected Impact**: 15% reduction in screen failures, 10% reduction in dropout
- **Financial ROI**: If trial costs $50M and timeline is 3 years, avoiding 2-3 month delay from poor enrollment = $4-6M savings

**Alternative for Budget Constraints**: Accellacare at $75K provides 80% of the value at 60% of the cost

- **Timeline**: 10 weeks fits within 9-month NICE appraisal timeline, leaving buffer for submission preparation
- **UK Focus**: NICE requires UK patient perspectives; Admedicum has established UK networks
- **ROI**: NICE approval determines UK market access; $95K investment is minimal vs. UK revenue potential
- **Risk Mitigation**: Using HTA specialists reduces risk of submission rejection due to inadequate patient evidence

**Timeline Strategy**:
- Month 1-2.5: Admedicum Patient Advisory Board (10 weeks)
- Month 3-6: Integrate patient evidence into full NICE submission
- Month 7: Internal review and finalization
- Month 8: Submit to NICE
- Month 9: NICE appraisal

**When to Consider Hybrid**: If this is a highly competitive therapeutic area (e.g., 3+ existing biologics) and differentiation is critical, add Clinigma patient preference study. Start Clinigma in parallel with Admedicum (Week 1) to complete both within 16 weeks.

- Higher cost
- May be overkill for simple hypothesis validation

**Methodology**:
- Recruit 15 neurologists (mix of academic and community)
- 3 online focus groups (5 per group)
- Professional moderation
- Formal analysis and reporting

**Deliverables**:
- Full research report
- Video recordings of focus groups
- Topline summary presentation

**Timeline**: 4 weeks

**Cost**: **$35,000**

**Best For**: Need for formal research, internal stakeholder buy-in requires professional report

---

#### **Option C: KJT (Targeted Qualitative)**

**Strengths**:
- Mid-market option (faster than Sago, more formal than GLG)
- Therapeutic area expertise
- Can do mix of individual interviews and small groups
- Professional deliverable

**Weaknesses**:
- Less global reach than Sago
- Smaller neurologist network than GLG

**Methodology**:

**Timeline**: 3 weeks

**Cost**: **$22,000**

**Best For**: Balance of speed, rigor, and cost

---

**RECOMMENDATION**: **GLG (Expert Network Consultations)**

**Rationale**:
- **Speed**: 2-3 weeks meets timeline requirement
- **Cost**: $10K is 30-70% less than alternatives
- **Fit-for-Purpose**: Hypothesis validation doesn't require formal research study
- **Flexibility**: Can start consultations immediately, adjust questions based on early findings
- **Decision-Making**: 10 expert opinions sufficient to validate or reject hypothesis

**Execution Plan**:
- **Week 1**: Schedule and complete 5 consultations
- **Week 2**: Schedule and complete 5 consultations, begin synthesis
- **Week 3**: Finalize synthesis, present findings to stakeholders

**Decision Criteria After GLG Validation**:
- **If hypothesis validated** (8+ of 10 neurologists confirm under-diagnosis): Proceed with educational initiative design
- **If hypothesis rejected** (fewer than 5 confirm): Pivot to alternative hypotheses, potentially commission Sago research to explore actual barriers
- **If mixed findings** (5-7 confirm): Segment neurologists (academic vs. community, geography, etc.) and design targeted approach

**When to Use Sago Instead**: If internal stakeholders require formal research report for budget approval of educational initiative, invest in Sago. The $25K incremental cost is justified if it secures $500K+ initiative budget.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis Framework

### **When to Invest in Premium Options**

**Invest in Specialist Agencies ($80K-200K) when:**
- Asset has blockbuster potential (>$1B peak sales)
- Regulatory approval hinges on patient evidence quality
- Competitive differentiation requires unique patient insights
- Failure cost is high (e.g., trial delays cost $1M+/month)

**ROI Calculation Example**:
- **Scenario**: Phase III trial costs $50M, takes 3 years
- **Problem**: 40% screen failure rate, 25% dropout rate
- **Investment**: $120K for Syneos protocol optimization
- **Impact**: 15% reduction in screen failures, 10% reduction in dropouts
- **Result**: 2-month faster enrollment, $3M savings in trial costs
- **ROI**: 25x return on $120K investment

### **When to Use Mid-Market Options**

**Choose Mid-Market Agencies ($40K-80K) when:**
- Standard research objectives (no unique methodological needs)
- Budget constraints but need professional deliverables
- Timeline is moderate (4-8 weeks acceptable)
- Internal stakeholders require formal reports

### **When to Use Budget Options**

**Select Budget Options ($10K-40K) when:**
- Hypothesis validation or exploratory research
- Timeline is critical (need insights in 2-3 weeks)
- Findings will inform decision to invest in larger research
- Internal synthesis capability exists
