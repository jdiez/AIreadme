  - **Focus**: Chronic conditions with ongoing engagement (diabetes, cardiovascular)
  - **Best For**: Longitudinal insights, co-creation projects
  - **Not Ideal For**: One-time studies or rare diseases

---

### **3. DATA & ANALYTICS DEPTH**

#### **Real-World Data Giants**
- **ICON plc (Symphony Health)**:
  - **Unique Capability**: Longitudinal data from 300M+ patients (claims, EMR, pharmacy)
  - **Analytics**: Patient journey mapping showing actual treatment patterns, switching behavior, drop-off points
  - **Quantification**: Can show "42% of patients discontinue within 6 months" with statistical significance
  - **Limitation**: Data-driven insights, not direct patient voice

#### **Expert Network Model**
- **GLG (Gerson Lehrman Group)**:
  - **Unique Capability**: On-demand access to 1M+ experts including patient advocates, rare disease patients
  - **Format**: 1-hour consultations, typically $400-1,200 per hour
  - **Best For**: Quick expert validation, hypothesis testing
  - **Limitation**: Not designed for structured research programs

---

### **4. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT INTEGRATION**

#### **Protocol Design Specialists**
- **Syneos Health (Patient Voice Consortium)**:
  - **Unique Capability**: Patient input integrated at protocol design stage (inclusion/exclusion criteria, endpoint selection)
  - **Consortium Model**: Standing patient advisory groups by therapeutic area
  - **Impact**: Can reduce screen failure rates by 15-25% through patient-informed criteria
  - **Best For**: Phase II/III trial design
  - **Not Ideal For**: Post-market research

#### **Feasibility & Retention Focus**
- **Accellacare**:
  - **Unique Capability**: Patient insights specifically for trial feasibility (site selection, visit burden assessment)
  - **Predictive**: Can forecast enrollment timelines and dropout risk
  - **Best For**: Operational trial planning
  - **Not Ideal For**: Therapeutic area strategy

---

### **5. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT BREADTH**

#### **Multi-Stakeholder Orchestration**
- **Patient Voice Partners**:
  - **Unique Capability**: Facilitates dialogue between patients, caregivers, clinicians, payers, and advocacy groups
  - **Deliverable**: Consensus recommendations from diverse stakeholder groups
  - **Best For**: Complex policy issues, market access strategy
  - **Not Ideal For**: Quick tactical research

#### **Pharma-Focused Patient Integration**
- **Clinigma**:
  - **Unique Capability**: Patient engagement specifically for drug development lifecycle
  - **Focus**: Ensuring patient voice authenticity (not just "professional patients")
  - **Best For**: Early asset development, patient preference studies
  - **Not Ideal For**: Broad market research

## Specific Use Case Mapping

### **Scenario 1: Rare Disease Launch Preparation**
**Best Choice**: **RPV** (recruitment) + **Admedicum** (HTA preparation)
- **Why**: RPV's rare disease database + Admedicum's regulatory expertise for reimbursement
- **Avoid**: ICON (insufficient rare disease patient volume)

### **Scenario 2: Phase III Trial Protocol Optimization**
**Best Choice**: **Syneos Health** (protocol design) + **Kayentis** (eCOA implementation)
- **Why**: Patient input on protocol + validated outcome measurement tools
- **Avoid**: Patient Voice Partners (too strategic, not operational)

### **Scenario 3: Understanding Treatment Adherence Barriers**
**Best Choice**: **HRW Healthcare** (behavioral insights) + **ICON** (real-world data validation)
- **Why**: Behavioral science qualitative insights + quantitative pattern confirmation
- **Avoid**: GLG (too fragmented for systematic understanding)

### **Scenario 4: Chronic Disease Patient Journey Mapping**
**Best Choice**: **Thrivable** (ongoing community) + **C+R Research** (journey analysis)
- **Why**: Longitudinal patient engagement + structured journey framework
- **Avoid**: Accellacare (clinical trial focus, not journey mapping)

### **Scenario 5: Quick Hypothesis Validation**
**Best Choice**: **GLG** (expert consultations) + **Sago** (rapid qualitative)
- **Why**: Fast access to patients and experts for validation
- **Avoid**: Syneos Health (consortium model too slow for quick validation)

### **Regulatory Expertise**
1. **Highest**: Admedicum (HTA-specific), Kayentis (PRO validation)
2. **Moderate**: Syneos Health (clinical development)
3. **Lower**: Thrivable, GLG (not regulatory-focused)

### **Cost Structure** (Estimated)
- **Premium**: GLG ($400-1,200/hour), ICON (enterprise contracts)
- **Mid-Range**: Syneos Health, HRW, Admedicum ($50K-200K projects)
- **Variable**: Sago, RPV ($200-500 per patient recruited + project fees)

- Methodology requires specialized expertise (behavioral science, HTA preparation)
- Need deep therapeutic area knowledge over geographic breadth
- Project requires regulatory-grade deliverables
- Budget allows for premium specialized services

### **Choose Broad Agencies When:**
- Need multi-country recruitment (5+ countries)
- Require integration with clinical operations or real-world data
- Project scope includes multiple research phases
- Need scalable infrastructure for large sample sizes (100+ patients)
- Prefer single-vendor accountability for complex programs

### **Hybrid Approach When:**
- Combining specialist recruitment (RPV) with broad analytics (ICON)
- Pairing methodology expertise (HRW) with scale (Sago)
- Integrating regulatory focus (Admedicum) with clinical operations (Syneos)
