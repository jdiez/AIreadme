## Summary Insights

**What Unites Them**: All agencies recognize that authentic patient voice is critical to healthcare innovation, drug development, and improved outcomes. They serve as intermediaries between patients and healthcare organizations.

**What Differentiates Them**: 
- **Specialists** offer deep expertise in specific methodologies, disease areas, or engagement approaches—ideal for complex, nuanced patient insight needs
- **Broad agencies** provide scale, comprehensive data infrastructure, and integrated solutions—ideal for large-scale research programs requiring multiple capabilities

**Selection Criteria for Pharma**: Choose specialists for targeted, methodology-driven projects requiring deep patient understanding; choose broad agencies for comprehensive programs requiring scale, data integration, and multiple research modalities.
