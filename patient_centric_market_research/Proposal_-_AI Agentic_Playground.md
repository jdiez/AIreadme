# Proposal: AI Agentic Playground for Patient-Centric Market Research

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of an **AI Agentic Playground**—an innovative, interactive environment where AI agents collaborate to transform patient-centric market research at AstraZeneca. By leveraging autonomous AI agents that can simulate, analyze, and synthesize patient insights across multiple dimensions, this playground will accelerate research cycles, uncover deeper patient insights, and enable more personalized therapeutic strategies.

**Strategic Value**: This initiative positions AstraZeneca at the forefront of AI-driven patient engagement, potentially reducing research timelines by 40-50% while improving the quality and depth of patient insights that inform drug development, clinical trial design, and commercial strategy.

## Problem Statement

Current patient-centric market research faces several critical challenges:

**Operational Inefficiencies**
- Manual synthesis of qualitative data from interviews, focus groups, and social listening is time-intensive and prone to bias
- Patient journey mapping requires extensive coordination across multiple data sources and stakeholder groups
- Real-time analysis of ePRO data and wearable device outputs remains fragmented

**Insight Limitations**
- Traditional methods struggle to identify nuanced patterns across diverse patient populations
- Integration of behavioral science overlays with clinical data requires specialized expertise that's not always available
- Predictive modeling of patient adherence and trial retention relies on historical data rather than dynamic simulation

**Scalability Constraints**
- Recruiting and engaging hard-to-reach patient populations (especially rare diseases) is resource-intensive
- Patient Advisory Boards and ethnographic studies are difficult to scale across multiple therapeutic areas simultaneously
- Personalization of patient engagement strategies requires manual segmentation and testing
