# Gap Analysis: Unmet Needs in Patient-Centric Market Research

## Critical Gaps in Current Agency Landscape

### **GAP 1: Real-Time Patient Experience Monitoring**

**What's Missing:**
- **Continuous passive data collection** from patients in their natural environment (not episodic research projects)
- Integration of wearables, smartphone sensors, and digital biomarkers with patient-reported outcomes
- Real-time symptom tracking correlated with treatment adherence, environmental factors, and daily activities

**Current State:**
- **Kayentis** offers eCOA but it's survey-based (active data collection, not passive)
- **Thrivable** has ongoing communities but relies on patient self-reporting
- **ICON** has retrospective claims data, not real-time lived experience

**Why It Matters:**
- Captures "in-the-moment" experiences vs. recall bias in traditional interviews
- Identifies patterns invisible in episodic research (e.g., "symptoms worsen on weekends when family stress is higher")
- Enables predictive analytics for adherence and outcomes

**Market Opportunity:**
- **Wearable Integration**: Partner with Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin to correlate activity/sleep/heart rate with patient-reported symptoms
- **Digital Phenotyping**: Smartphone keyboard dynamics, voice analysis, GPS patterns as proxies for mental health, mobility, social engagement
- **Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)**: Brief surveys triggered by contextual factors (time of day, location, physiological signals)

**Who Could Fill This:**
- Tech-enabled research startups (e.g., **HealthPal**, **Evidation Health**)
- None of the listed agencies have this capability natively

### **GAP 2: Pediatric Patient Voice (Children 5-17)**

**What's Missing:**
- **Age-appropriate research methodologies** for children and adolescents
- Parent/child dyadic research that separates child perspective from parent proxy
- Developmental stage-specific approaches (early childhood vs. adolescence)
- School-based recruitment and research (vs. clinical settings)

**Current State:**
- Most agencies recruit "patients and caregivers" but treat children as passive subjects
- **HRW's Soulmate interviews** pair patients with caregivers but assume adult patients
- **RPV** has pediatric rare disease patients but methodology is adult-adapted

**Why It Matters:**
- FDA increasingly requires pediatric patient preference data (Pediatric Research Equity Act)
- Children's treatment priorities differ from parents' (e.g., kids prioritize "can I play sports?" over "will I live longer?")
- Adolescents have unique adherence barriers (peer pressure, identity formation, rebellion)

**Specific Methodological Gaps:**
- **Visual/Creative Methods**: Drawing, photography, video diaries (not just interviews)
- **Gaming/Gamification**: Research embedded in age-appropriate digital experiences

### **GAP 7: End-of-Life & Palliative Care Patient Voice**

**What's Missing:**
- **Research with terminally ill patients** about treatment preferences, quality of life, end-of-life care
- Advance care planning and goals of care discussions
- Palliative care needs assessment (pain, symptom management, psychosocial support)
- Bereavement research with family members after patient death

**Current State:**
- Most agencies avoid end-of-life research (ethical complexity, emotional burden, recruitment challenges)
- **RPV** may have terminally ill patients in database but no specialized methodology
- Hospice and palliative care research is primarily academic, not commercial

**Why It Matters:**
- Oncology drugs increasingly used in late-stage disease (need patient perspective on quality vs. quantity of life)
- Palliative care interventions need patient input on what matters most
- Advance care planning tools require patient preferences on trade-offs
- Payers interested in reducing unnecessary end-of-life hospitalizations (need patient/family perspective)

**Specific Research Needs:**
- **Sensitive Interviewing**: Researchers trained in end-of-life communication
- **Proxy Research**: When patients too ill to participate, validated methods for family proxy
- **Goals of Care Elicitation**: Understanding what patients value most (time with family, pain control, cognitive function)
- **Bereavement Follow-Up**: Family perspectives on quality of end-of-life care (after patient death)

**Who Could Fill This:**
- Hospice/palliative care organizations (but lack commercial research infrastructure)
- Academic medical centers (but not commercialized)

- Insurance navigation challenges and prior authorization burden
- Medical debt and bankruptcy risk

**Current State:**
- **C+R Research** and **KJT** may touch on affordability as barrier to adoption
- **ICON** has claims data showing discontinuation but not financial reasons
- Most agencies avoid financial topics (seen as sensitive, outside scope)

**Why It Matters:**
- Financial toxicity is leading cause of treatment non-adherence (40-60% of patients report cost-related non-adherence)
- High-deductible health plans shifting costs to patients
- Pharma companies need patient perspective on pricing, copay assistance, value-based contracting
- Payers interested in patient willingness-to-pay and affordability thresholds

**Specific Research Needs:**
- **Financial Burden Assessment**: Validated instruments for measuring financial toxicity
- **Affordability Thresholds**: What patients can/will pay out-of-pocket for treatments
