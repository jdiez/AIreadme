# AI Agentic Playground for Rare Disease Patient-Centric Market Research
## Executive Summary

---

### Strategic Opportunity

Rare disease drug development faces a fundamental challenge: **understanding and authentically representing patient perspectives when patient populations are small, geographically dispersed, and difficult to access**. Traditional patient engagement methods—while essential—are time-intensive (8-12 weeks per cycle), costly ($525K-$1M annually per program), and cannot scale across AstraZeneca's growing rare disease portfolio.

The **AI Agentic Playground** addresses this challenge by creating specialized AI agents that impersonate the full stakeholder ecosystem—patients at different disease stages, advocates, patient organization representatives, and AZ employees across functions. These agents enable rapid exploration of scenarios, hypothesis generation, and strategic planning, **always validated with real patient engagement for critical decisions**.

---

### How It Works

**Agent Generation**: AI agents are created using role-based templates, disease-specific knowledge, and realistic persona parameters. Each agent authentically represents a stakeholder perspective based on published literature, patient registries, social media analysis, and patient organization materials.

**Interaction Modes**: Users can conduct sequential consultations, multi-agent dialogue simulations (e.g., virtual advisory boards), scenario planning, and patient journey co-creation—exploring multiple perspectives in days rather than months.

**Validation Framework**: All critical insights are validated with real patients through advisory boards, interviews, and patient preference studies. AI serves as a hypothesis generator and scenario planner, not a replacement for authentic patient engagement.

### Business Impact

**Efficiency Gains**:
- **60-80% cost reduction** per research cycle ($100K-180K vs. $525K-$1M)
- **60% time savings** (4 weeks vs. 8-12 weeks from question to insight)
- **3x scalability**: Conduct more patient research with same resources

**Quality Improvements**:
- Explore diverse patient perspectives and scenarios comprehensively
- Identify protocol design issues before expensive amendments
- Optimize patient support programs for retention and satisfaction
- Navigate ethical dilemmas with multi-stakeholder input

**Strategic Value**:
- **Clinical Trials**: 20% faster enrollment, 15% improved retention through better protocol design
- **Regulatory Success**: Stronger patient voice documentation for submissions
- **Market Access**: Improved reimbursement outcomes through patient-centric value evidence
- **Competitive Advantage**: Industry-leading patient-centric innovation

**Conservative 3-Year ROI**: **20-40x** ($200M-400M return on $8M-10M investment)

### Pilot Plan: Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) & Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) (4 Months, $1.1M)

**Month 1**: Build gMG and NMOSD-specific knowledge bases and agent templates  
**Month 2**: Execute 3 use cases per indication (protocol optimization, patient support design, treatment access strategy)  
**Month 3**: Comprehensive validation with real patients and patient organizations (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, Guthy-Jackson Charitable Foundation)  
**Month 4**: Refinement and expansion planning

**Success Criteria**: 80%+ agent realism rating, 85%+ validation alignment, 3+ actionable recommendations implemented per indication

**Rationale for gMG & NMOSD Selection**:
- **Established AZ/Alexion expertise** with approved therapies and deep disease understanding
- **Active patient communities** with strong organizations for co-development partnership (MGFA, GJCF)
- **Complex treatment landscapes** where patient perspective is critical (infusion burden, attack prevention, quality of life priorities)
- **Complementary disease profiles**: gMG (chronic progressive) vs. NMOSD (relapsing-remitting) enabling validation across different rare disease archetypes
- **High unmet needs** in both indications with ongoing development programs

---

### Ethical Framework & Governance

**Co-Development with Patient Organizations**: Patient organizations review agent representations, validate insights, and provide ongoing oversight through advisory board participation.

**Transparency & Validation**: All AI use clearly disclosed; critical decisions validated with real patients; AI positioned as complement to authentic engagement, never replacement.

**Rigorous Oversight**: Ethics review board, patient advisory board, and steering committee provide multi-layered governance with clear escalation protocols.

---

### Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Months 1-4)**: gMG and NMOSD pilot with 8 agent roles per indication, 3 use cases each, comprehensive validation  
**Phase 2 (Months 5-8)**: Expand to 3-5 additional rare diseases (PNH, aHUS, CIDP), 15+ agent roles, cross-functional deployment (50+ trained users)  
**Phase 3 (Months 9-12)**: Scale across all rare disease programs, external partnerships, regulatory engagement

**Investment**: $2.5M-3.6M Year 1, $2M-2.5M annually thereafter  
**Team**: 6-8 FTEs (AI/ML engineers, patient insights specialists, data scientists) plus extended cross-functional support

---

### Regulatory Strategy

**Conservative Application**: Use AI for internal strategy and hypothesis generation; validate all regulatory claims with real patients  
**Proactive Transparency**: Engage FDA/EMA early about methodology; position as innovative complement to traditional patient engagement  
**Documentation Excellence**: Maintain rigorous validation records; publish methodology in peer-reviewed journals

---

### Recommendation

**Approve pilot program** to validate AI agentic methodology for rare disease patient research. This initiative positions AstraZeneca as the industry leader in patient-centric innovation while delivering substantial ROI through faster development, better trial design, and improved patient outcomes.

The future of rare disease research is not choosing between AI efficiency and patient authenticity—**it's using AI to enable more authentic, comprehensive, and impactful patient engagement than ever before possible**.

**Next Steps**: Secure executive sponsorship, establish patient advisory board with gMG and NMOSD patient representatives, initiate 4-month dual-indication pilot with defined success criteria.
